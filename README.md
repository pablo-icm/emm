# Ecology of Marine Microbes website repository  

[![EMM](https://github.com/pablo-icm/emm/blob/main/static/images/roseta-garcia.JPG)

This is the public github repository for the EMM website. This website is based on the [**Research Group Template**](https://github.com/wowchemy/starter-hugo-research-group) 

If you want to be an editor of the website, first you need a GitHub user account. Send a request to Pablo and follow the instructions from the [wiki](https://github.com/pablo-icm/emm/wiki).  Ideally, at least each Pi should be (or appoint) one website editor.   

The integrated [**Wowchemy**](https://hugoblox.com) website builder and CMS makes it easy to create a website. Edit the site in the CMS (or your favorite editor), generate it with [Hugo](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo), and deploy with GitHub. The theme can (and has been heavily) be customized modifying the template or adding widgets.
