subtitle: 'The Ecology of Marine Microorganisms Research group was created in 1997 to join scientists interested in understanding how the marine microbial plankton functions and how is affected by environmental gradients. Today, the group studies the full microbial food web (viruses, prokaryotes and microbial eukaryotes) and apply complementary tools to data acquired from: (i) oceanographic cruises, (ii) a permanent sampling station ([Blanes Bay Microbial Observatory](https://bbmo.icm.csic.es/)), and (iii) experiments in the lab. The EMM Research group includes 9 senior scientists, 11 postdocs, 14 PhD students and 7 technicians and has a longstanding track record in training students and researchers from a variety of levels and backgrounds. The group is continuously funded by National and EU projects, and has participated in the global Malaspina and Tara Oceans circumnavigation programs.<br><br>'
