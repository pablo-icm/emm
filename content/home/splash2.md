The **Ecology of Marine Microorganisms** Research group, based at the Institute of Marine Sciences (ICM-CSIC, Barcelona), integrates scientists from different disciplines and research topics that use complementary methods to address the ecological and functional role of marine microorganisms at different resolutions from communities to species or ecotypes.  

Our current interests are summarized in the following research lines: 
- Biodiversity and biogeography  
- Microbial Activities: From Single Cells to Biogeochemical Cycles  
- Genes and Genomes: Function and Evolution   

The group is located at the (sometimes) beautiful Somorrostro beach, in Barcelona, at the [ICM-CSIC](https:/icm.csic.es).
