Here we provide a tool to investigate the seasonality of picoeukaryotic taxa during a monthly survey of 10 years at the Blanes Bay Microbial Observatory (BBMO). This site is a coastal monitoring station located near the city of Blanes in the NW Mediterranean Sea (41°40′N, 2°48′E) with a focus on the abundance, diversity and activity of marine microorganisms. The diversity dataset derives from environmental V4-18S rDNA sequences (Giner et al. 2019), and can be queried via BLAST or by specifying the taxa of interest.
