At the Blanes Bay Microbial Observatory (BBMO) we study the microbial components of the marine ecosystem. We focus on the genomic, functional and species diversity of  microbes,  linking them to the cycling of carbon, sulfur and other elements in the marine plankton. BBMO is representative of an oligotrophic (relatively nutrient-poor) coastal ecosystem which is relatively unaffected by human and terrestrial influences. BBMO includes extensive information on the ecology of the Mediterranean marine plankton, with publications dating back to the 1950â€™s. Microbial data from the site goes back to 1992, and it has been sampled at monthy periodicity since March 2001.
