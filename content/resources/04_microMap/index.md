MicroMap is a web application that can be used to map global microbial abundance. It has a set of ASVs (Amplicon Sequence Variants) of 16S and 18S rDNA genes from microbial communities sampled during the Malaspina expedition. After a request, it will identify all ASVs matching the query and create a map displaying their relative abundance at the surface and along vertical profiles. Depending on the database you may perform queries using 16S/18S rDNA sequences, taxonomic classifications or sequence identifiers.
