abstract: Microbial reduction of inorganic divalent mercury (Hg2+) and methylmercury
  (MeHg) demethylation is performed by the mer operon, specifically by merA and merB
  genes, respectively, but little is known about the mercury tolerance capacity of
  marine microorganisms and its prevalence in the ocean. Here, combining culture-dependent
  analyses with metagenomic and metatranscriptomic data, we show that marine bacteria
  that encode mer genes are widespread and active in the global ocean. We explored
  the distribution of these genes in 290 marine heterotrophic bacteria (Alteromonas
  and Marinobacter spp.) isolated from different oceanographic regions and depths,
  and assessed their tolerance to diverse concentrations of Hg2+ and MeHg. In particular,
  the Alteromonas sp. ISS312 strain presented the highest tolerance capacity and a
  degradation efficiency for MeHg of 98.2% in 24 h. Fragment recruitment analyses
  of Alteromonas sp. genomes (ISS312 strain and its associated reconstructed metagenome
  assembled genome MAG-0289) against microbial bathypelagic metagenomes confirm their
  prevalence in the deep ocean. Moreover, we retrieved 54 merA and 6 merB genes variants
  related to the Alteromonas sp. ISS312 strain from global metagenomes and metatranscriptomes
  from Tara Oceans. Our findings highlight the biological reductive MeHg degradation
  as a relevant pathway of the ocean Hg biogeochemical cycle.
