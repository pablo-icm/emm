abstract: Strain ISS653 T , isolated from Atlantic seawater, is a yellow pigmented,
  non-motile, Gram-reaction-negative rod-shaped bacterium, strictly aerobic and chemoorganotrophic,
  slightly halophilic (1–15 % NaCl) and mesophilic (4–37 °C), oxidase- and catalase-positive
  and proteolytic. Its major cellular fatty acids are iso-C 15 : 0 , iso-C 15 : 0
  2-OH, and iso-C 17 : 0 3-OH; the major identified phospholipid is phosphatidylethanolamine
  and the major respiratory quinone is MK6. Genome size is 4.28 Mbp and DNA G+C content
  is 34.9 mol%. 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity places the strain among members
  of the family Flavobacteriaceae, with the type strains of   Mesonia phycicola   (93.2 %),   Salegentibacter
  mishustinae   (93.1 %) and   Mesonia mobilis   (92.9 %) as closest relatives. Average
  amino acid identity (AAI) and average nucleotide identity (ANI) indices show highest
  values with   M. mobilis   (81 % AAI; 78.9 % ANI),   M. phycicola   (76 % AAI; 76.3 %
  ANI),   Mesonia maritima   (72 % AAI, 74.9 % ANI),   Mesonia hippocampi   (64 %
  AAI, 70.8 % ANI) and   Mesonia algae   (68 % AAI; 72.2 % ANI). Phylogenomic analysis
  using the Up-to-date-Bacterial Core Gene set (UBCG) merges strain ISS653 T in a
  clade with species of the genus   Mesonia   . We conclude that strain ISS653 T represents
  a novel species of the genus   Mesonia   for which we propose the name Mesonia oceanica
  sp. nov., and strain ISS653 T (=CECT 9532 T =LMG 31236 T ) as the type strain. A
  second strain of the species, ISS1889 (=CECT 30008) was isolated from Pacific Ocean
  seawater. Data obtained throughout the Tara oceans expedition indicate that the
  species is more abundant in the mesopelagic dark ocean than in the photic layer
  and it is more frequent in the South Pacific, Indian and North Atlantic oceans.
