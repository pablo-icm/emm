T
, isolated from Atlantic seawater, is a yellow pigmented, non-motile, Gram-reaction-negative rod-shaped bacterium, strictly aerobic and chemoorganotrophic, slightly halophilic (1–15 % NaCl) and mesophilic (4–37 °C), oxidase- and catalase-positive and proteolytic. Its major cellular fatty acids are iso-C

, iso-C

2-OH, and iso-C

3-OH; the major identified phospholipid is phosphatidylethanolamine and the major respiratory quinone is MK6. Genome size is 4.28 Mbp and DNA G+C content is 34.9 mol%. 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity places the strain among members of the family
Flavobacteriaceae,
with the type strains of


Mesonia phycicola


(93.2 %),


Salegentibacter mishustinae


(93.1 %) and


Mesonia mobilis


(92.9 %) as closest relatives. Average amino acid identity (AAI) and average nucleotide identity (ANI) indices show highest values with


M. mobilis


(81 % AAI; 78.9 % ANI),


M. phycicola


(76 % AAI; 76.3 % ANI),


Mesonia maritima


(72 % AAI, 74.9 % ANI),


Mesonia hippocampi


(64 % AAI, 70.8 % ANI) and


Mesonia algae


(68 % AAI; 72.2 % ANI). Phylogenomic analysis using the Up-to-date-Bacterial Core Gene set (UBCG) merges strain ISS653
T
in a clade with species of the genus


Mesonia


. We conclude that strain ISS653
T
represents a novel species of the genus


Mesonia


for which we propose the name
Mesonia oceanica
sp. nov., and strain ISS653
T
(=CECT 9532
T
=LMG 31236
T
) as the type strain. A second strain of the species, ISS1889 (=CECT 30008) was isolated from Pacific Ocean seawater. Data obtained throughout the
Tara
oceans expedition indicate that the species is more abundant in the mesopelagic dark ocean than in the photic layer and it is more frequent in the South Pacific, Indian and North Atlantic oceans.},
