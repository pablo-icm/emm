abstract: ABSTRACT We used denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) to study
  the diversity of picoeukaryotes in natural marine assemblages. Two eukaryote-specific
  primer sets targeting different regions of the 18S rRNA gene were tested. Both primer
  sets gave a single band when used with algal cultures and complex fingerprints when
  used with natural assemblages. The reproducibility of the fingerprints was estimated
  by quantifying the intensities of the same bands obtained in independent PCR and
  DGGE analyses, and the standard error of these estimates was less than 2% on average.
  DGGE fingerprints were then used to compare the picoeukaryotic diversity in samples
  obtained at different depths and on different dates from a station in the southwest
  Mediterranean Sea. Both primer sets revealed significant differences along the vertical
  profile, whereas temporal differences at the same depths were less marked. The phylogenetic
  composition of picoeukaryotes from one surface sample was investigated by excising
  and sequencing DGGE bands. The results were compared with an analysis of a clone
  library and a terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism fingerprint obtained
  from the same sample. The three PCR-based methods, performed with three different
  primer sets, revealed very similar assemblage compositions; the same main phylogenetic
  groups were present at similar relative levels. Thus, the prasinophyte group appeared
  to be the most abundant group in the surface Mediterranean samples as determined
  by our molecular analyses. DGGE bands corresponding to prasinophytes were always
  found in surface samples but were not present in deep samples. Other groups detected
  were prymnesiophytes, novel stramenopiles (distantly related to hyphochytrids or
  labyrinthulids), cryptophytes, dinophytes, and pelagophytes. In conclusion, the
  DGGE method described here provided a reasonably detailed view of marine picoeukaryotic
  assemblages and allowed tentative phylogenetic identification of the dominant members.
