abstract: 'The Ocean microbiome has a crucial role in Earth’s biogeochemical cycles.
  During the last decade, global cruises such as Tara Oceans and the Malaspina Expedition
  have expanded our understanding of the diversity and genetic repertoire of marine
  microbes. Nevertheless, there are still knowledge gaps regarding their diversity
  patterns throughout depth gradients ranging from the surface to the deep ocean.
  Here we present a dataset of 76 microbial metagenomes (MProfile) of the picoplankton
  size fraction (0.2–3.0 µm) collected in 11 vertical profiles covering contrasting
  ocean regions sampled during the Malaspina Expedition circumnavigation (7 depths,
  from surface to 4,000 m deep). The MProfile dataset produced 1.66 Tbp of raw DNA
  sequences from which we derived: 17.4 million genes clustered at 95% sequence similarity
  (M-GeneDB-VP), 2,672 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) of Archaea and Bacteria
  (Malaspina-VP-MAGs), and over 100,000 viral genomic sequences. This dataset will
  be a valuable resource for exploring the functional and taxonomic connectivity between
  the photic and bathypelagic tropical and sub-tropical ocean, while increasing our
  general knowledge of the Ocean microbiome.'
