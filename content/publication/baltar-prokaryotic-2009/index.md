abstract: Summary Prokaryotic extracellular enzymatic activity, abundance, heterotrophic
  production and respiration were determined in the meso‐ and bathypelagic (sub)tropical
  North Atlantic. While prokaryotic heterotrophic production (PHP) decreased from
  the lower euphotic layer to the bathypelagic waters by two orders of magnitude,
  prokaryotic abundance and cell‐specific PHP decreased only by one order of magnitude.
  In contrast to cell‐specific PHP, cell‐specific extracellular enzymatic activity
  (alpha‐ and beta‐glucosidase, leucine aminopeptidase, alkaline phosphatase) increased
  with depth as did cell‐specific respiration rates. Cell‐specific alkaline phosphatase
  activity increased from the intermediate water masses to the deep waters up to fivefold.
  Phosphate concentrations, however, varied only by a factor of two between the different
  water masses, indicating that phosphatase activity is not related to phosphate availability
  in the deep waters. Generally, cell‐specific extracellular enzymatic activities
  were inversely related to cell‐specific prokaryotic leucine incorporation. Thus,
  it is apparent that the utilization of deep ocean organic matter is linked to higher
  cell‐specific extracellular enzymatic activity and respiration and lower cell‐specific
  PHP than in surface waters.
