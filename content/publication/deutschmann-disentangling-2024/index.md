abstract: Abstract Microbial interactions are vital in maintaining ocean ecosystem
  function, yet their dynamic nature and complexity remain largely unexplored. Here,
  we use association networks to investigate possible ecological interactions in the
  marine microbiome among archaea, bacteria, and picoeukaryotes throughout different
  depths and geographical regions of the tropical and subtropical global ocean. Our
  findings reveal that potential microbial interactions change with depth and geographical
  scale, exhibiting highly heterogeneous distributions. A few potential interactions
  were global, meaning they occurred across regions at the same depth, while 11-36%
  were regional within specific depths. The bathypelagic zone had the lowest proportion
  of global associations, and regional associations increased with depth. Moreover,
  we observed that most surface water associations do not persist in deeper ocean
  layers despite microbial vertical dispersal. Our work contributes to a deeper understanding
  of the tropical and subtropical global ocean interactome, which is essential for
  addressing the challenges posed by global change.
