abstract: The seasonal variation in the grazing effect of mixotrophic flagellates
  on bacterioplankton was assessed during an annual cycle in an oligotrophic coastal
  station in the northwest Mediterranean Sea. Ingestion rates of fluorescently labeled
  bacteria were estimated for different size categories of phytoflagellates (PF) and
  heterotrophic flagellates (HF) in short‐term experiments and compared with long‐term
  grazing estimates and published empirical models. The mixotrophic flagellates included
  haptophyte‐like cells, cryptophytes, and dinoflagellates. The group‐specific grazing
  rates (SGR) averaged 1.1 (3–5 µm PF), 1.3 (5–20 µm PF), 4.0 (textless5 µm HF), and
  15.4 bacteria individual −1 h −1 (5‐20 µm HF). Lower SGR but higher abundances of
  PF resulted in an average mixotroph contribution of 50% to the total flagellate
  grazing. Remarkably, the effect was relatively high all through the year (35–65%).
  Regardless of the presence of chloroplasts, flagellates textless5 mm in size accounted,
  on average, for about 80% of total flagellate bacterivory and ingested a large percentage
  of their cell carbon per day from bacteria. Soluble reactive phosphorus concentration
  was negatively correlated with the ingestion rate of both groups of PF, suggesting
  that mixotrophic flagellates would be using their phagotrophic capability to obtain
  phosphorus when this nutrient is limiting. HF grazing activity showed a marked seasonality,
  with grazing being higher during the warmer seasons, and clearance rates were positively
  correlated with water temperature. Total bacterivory accounted for most of the bacterial
  production. Short‐term and long‐term bacterivory measurements were highly correlated,
  confirming that the smallest flagellates were the main causative agent of bacterial
  loss. The bacterivory values were also well correlated to a published empirical
  model that considers HF as the only bacterivorous. However, this model underestimated
  (up to 50%) total flagellate grazing during periods of high effect of mixotrophic
  flagellates.
