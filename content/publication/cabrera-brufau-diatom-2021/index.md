abstract: Particulate organic matter (POM) lability is one of the key factors determining
  the residence time of organic carbon (OC) in the marine system. Phytoplankton community
  composition can influence the rate at which heterotrophic microorganisms decompose
  phytoplankton detrital particles and thus, it controls the fraction of OC that reaches
  the ocean depths, where it can be sequestered for climate-relevant spans of time.
  Here, we compared the degradation dynamics of POM from phytoplankton assemblages
  of contrasting diatom dominance in the presence of mesopelagic prokaryotic communities
  during a 19-day degradation experiment. We found that diatom-derived POM exhibited
  an exponential decay rate approximately three times lower than that derived from
  a community dominated by flagellated phytoplankton (mainly coccolithophores and
  nanoflagellates). Additionally, dissolved organic matter (DOM) released during the
  degradation of diatom particles accumulated over the experiment, whereas only residual
  increases in DOM were detected during the degradation of non-diatom materials. These
  results suggest that diatom-dominance enhances the efficiencies of the biological
  carbon pump and microbial carbon pump through the relatively reduced labilities
  of diatom particles and of the dissolved materials that arise from their microbial
  processing.
