abstract: Marine sediments polluted from anthropogenic activities can be major reservoirs
  of toxic mercury species. Some microorganisms in these environments have the capacity
  to detoxify these pollutants, by using the mer operon. In this study, we characterized
  microbial cultures isolated from polluted marine sediments growing under diverse
  environmental conditions of salinity, oxygen availability and mercury tolerance.
  Specific growth rates and percentage of mercury removal were measured in batch cultures
  for a selection of isolates. A culture affiliated with Pseudomonas putida (MERCC_1942),
  which contained a mer operon as well as other genes related to metal resistances,
  was selected as the best candidate for mercury elimination. In order to optimize
  mercury detoxification conditions for strain MERCC_1942 in continuous culture, three
  different dilution rates were tested in bioreactors until the cultures achieved
  steady state, and they were subsequently exposed to a mercury spike; after 24 h,
  strain MERCC_1942 removed up to 76% of the total mercury. Moreover, when adapted
  to high growth rates in bioreactors, this strain exhibited the highest specific
  mercury detoxification rates. Finally, an immobilization protocol using the sol-gel
  technology was optimized. These results highlight that some sediment bacteria show
  capacity to detoxify mercury and could be used for bioremediation applications.
