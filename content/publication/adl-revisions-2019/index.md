abstract: Abstract  This revision of the classification of eukaryotes follows that
  of Adl et al., 2012 [ J. Euk. Microbiol . 59(5)] and retains an emphasis on protists.
  Changes since have improved the resolution of many nodes in phylogenetic analyses.
  For some clades even families are being clearly resolved. As we had predicted, environmental
  sampling in the intervening years has massively increased the genetic information
  at hand. Consequently, we have discovered novel clades, exciting new genera and
  uncovered a massive species level diversity beyond the morphological species descriptions.
  Several clades known from environmental samples only have now found their home.
  Sampling soils, deeper marine waters and the deep sea will continue to fill us with
  surprises. The main changes in this revision are the confirmation that eukaryotes
  form at least two domains, the loss of monophyly in the Excavata, robust support
  for the Haptista and Cryptista. We provide suggested primer sets for DNA sequences
  from environmental samples that are effective for each clade. We have provided a
  guide to trophic functional guilds in an appendix, to facilitate the interpretation
  of environmental samples, and a standardized taxonomic guide for East Asian users.
