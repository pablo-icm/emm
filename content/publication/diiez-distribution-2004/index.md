abstract: We used a molecular fingerprinting technique to analyze the distribution
  and composition of eukaryotic picoplankton along latitudinal transects in the Southern
  Ocean. First, primers specific for eukaryotic 18S rDNA were used in a polymerase
  chain reaction (PCR) with environmental DNA. The amplification products were subjected
  to denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). Transect DOVETAIL (44°W) went
  from the ice edge (at 60°S) across the Weddell‐Scotia confluence and north to 58°S;
  it was sampled in January 1998 (summer). Transect DHARMA (between 53°W and 58°W)
  went from the ice edge in the Weddell Sea (63°S) across the Drake Passage to the
  South American continental platform (55°S); it was sampled in December 1998 (late
  spring). DGGE band patterns were used to build dendrograms combining samples from
  each cruise. Samples were grouped in several distinct clusters that were generally
  consistent with the hydrography of the area. In DOVETAIL, the upper water column
  was stratified and the DGGE band patterns varied with depth. In DHARMA the upper
  mixed layer showed the same composition of the eukaryotic picoplankton at all depths.
  The most dominant DGGE bands were excised and sequenced. Some were closely related
  to well‐known components of the plankton such as prasinophytes, prymnesiophytes,
  dinoflagellates, and diatoms. A significant number of sequences were related to
  previously unknown phylogenetic groups, including novel stramenopiles and alveolates
  or to poorly known groups such as cercomonads. This fingerprinting technique is
  useful for a rapid evaluation of the spatial distribution of picoeukaryotic assemblages
  in the oceans.
