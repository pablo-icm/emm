abstract: 'We investigated the short‐term effects of variable solar irradiance and
  spectrum on the gross biological production of dimethylsulfide (DMS), a trace gas
  with potential climatic effects, in eight experiments performed at different times
  of the year in a northwest Mediterranean coastal site. Experimentally determined
  net community DMS production, DMS photolysis, and dark microbial DMS consumption
  rates were used to calculate gross community DMS production by budgeting. In addition,
  the composition of the bacterioplankton and phytoplankton communities in the initial
  samples, and the photoinhibition of bulk bacterial heterotrophic activity and phytoplankton
  photosynthetic efficiency were monitored. Our results show that: (1) gross DMS production
  is irradiance dependent, with a maximum short‐term stimulation factor of 2‐ to 6‐fold
  compared to dark incubations; (2) its spectral shape is variable but generally similar
  to that of phytoplankton photoinhibition or photodamage, with more effective stimulation
  at shorter ultraviolet wavelengths; and (3) stronger stimulation occurs when samples
  are overexposed with respect to their prior exposure. Remarkably, the photoresponse
  of gross DMS production was in most cases strong enough to (at least) compensate
  the photochemical DMS loss at the water subsurface. Such response would prevent
  DMS depletion in stratified and highly irradiated waters. Since the initial microbial
  communities were representative of meso‐ to oligotrophic conditions, our observations
  should apply to a wide variety of oceanic regimes.'
