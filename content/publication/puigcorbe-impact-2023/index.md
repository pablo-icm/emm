abstract: Antarctic polynyas are highly productive open water areas surrounded by
  ice where extensive phytoplankton blooms occur, but little is known about how these
  surface blooms influence carbon fluxes and prokaryotic communities from deeper waters.
  By sequencing the 16S rRNA gene, we explored the vertical connectivity of the prokaryotic
  assemblages associated with particles of three different sizes in two polynyas with
  different surface productivity, and we linked it to the magnitude of the particle
  export fluxes measured using thorium-234 ( 234 Th) as particle tracer. Between the
  sunlit and the mesopelagic layers (700 m depth), we observed compositional changes
  in the prokaryotic communities associated with the three size-fractions, which were
  mostly dominated by Flavobacteriia , Alphaproteobacteria , and Gammaproteobacteria
  . Interestingly, the vertical differences between bacterial communities attached
  to the largest particles decreased with increasing 234 Th export fluxes, indicating
  a more intense downward transport of surface prokaryotes in the most productive
  polynya. This was accompanied by a higher proportion of surface prokaryotic taxa
  detected in deep particle-attached microbial communities in the station with the
  highest 234 Th export flux. Our results support recent studies evidencing links
  between surface productivity and deep prokaryotic communities and provide the first
  evidence of sinking particles acting as vectors of microbial diversity to depth
  in Antarctic polynyas, highlighting the direct influence of particle export in shaping
  the prokaryotic communities of mesopelagic waters.
