abstract: The world’s oceans sustain the life for an estimated total of 10 microbial cells. Marine bacteria are responsible for most part of the ocean respiration and are key in most biogeochemical cycles of the Earth. Accordingly, the study of the bacterial diversity present in different marine ecosystems is essential, and having access to their genomes through isolation or genomic centric studies is important to decipher their metabolic potential. Isolation of marine microorganisms is fundamental to gather information about their physiology, ecology and genomic content. To date, most of the bacterial isolation efforts have focused on the photic ocean leaving the deep ocean less explored. In this thesis, standard plating techniques allowed to create a marine culture collection of heterotrophic bacteria (MARINHET). More than 2000 isolates were retrieved from samples collected from a variety of oceanographic regions, from different depths including surface, mesopelagic and bathypelagic waters, and also covering different seasons and years. Chapter 1 describes the taxonomy, the phylogenetic diversity and the biogeography of culturable heterotrophic marine bacteria, and reveals that an important percentage of the strains (37 %) are 100 % identical in their partial 16S rRNA gene between photic and aphotic layers. In addition, we identified Alteromonas and Erythrobacter genera as the most frequently retrieved heterotrophic bacteria from the ocean in standard marine agar medium.
