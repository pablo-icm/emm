abstract: The Northern Adriatic Sea is a key area of the Mediterranean Sea, strongly
  affected by freshwater inputs, mainly from the Po River, which bring high amounts
  of nutrients as well as organic and inorganic particles. Free-living and particle-attached
  prokaryotes were characterized by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing of size-fractionated
  samples collected during a diatom bloom in this area. The diversity of free-living
  and particle-attached prokaryotic assemblages was investigated with the aim to understand
  how the microbial communities are structured in the two fractions and whether specific
  microbial groups are associated to one lifestyle or the other. The results highlight
  a diverse prokaryotic community dominated by Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and,
  remarkably, Firmicutes. Taxa within Firmicutes and Alphaproteobacteria are identified
  as the main particle-attached indicators by LEfSe, while members of Bacteroidetes
  and Gammaproteobacteria were representative of the free-living lifestyle, although
  they were also usually found as particle-attached. Collectively, the results suggest
  that both the free-living and the particle-attached lifestyles are a complex combination
  of specialization and adaptation to local conditions.
