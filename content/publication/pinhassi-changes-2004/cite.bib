The results of empirical studies have revealed links between phytoplankton and bacterioplankton, such as the frequent correlation between chlorophyll
a
and bulk bacterial abundance and production. Nevertheless, little is known about possible links at the level of specific taxonomic groups. To investigate this issue, seawater microcosm experiments were performed in the northwestern Mediterranean Sea. Turbulence was used as a noninvasive means to induce phytoplankton blooms dominated by different algae. Microcosms exposed to turbulence became dominated by diatoms, while small phytoflagellates gained importance under still conditions. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of 16S rRNA gene fragments showed that changes in phytoplankton community composition were followed by shifts in bacterioplankton community composition, both as changes in the presence or absence of distinct bacterial phylotypes and as differences in the relative abundance of ubiquitous phylotypes. Sequencing of DGGE bands showed that four
Roseobacter
phylotypes were present in all microcosms. The microcosms with a higher proportion of phytoflagellates were characterized by four phylotypes of the
Bacteroidetes
phylum: two affiliated with the family
Cryomorphaceae
and two with the family
Flavobacteriaceae
. Two other
Flavobacteriaceae
phylotypes were characteristic of the diatom-dominated microcosms, together with one
Alphaproteobacteria
phylotype (
Roseobacter
) and one
Gammaproteobacteria
phylotype (
Methylophaga
). Phylogenetic analyses of published
Bacteroidetes
16S rRNA gene sequences confirmed that members of the
Flavobacteriaceae
are remarkably responsive to phytoplankton blooms, indicating these bacteria could be particularly important in the processing of organic matter during such events. Our data suggest that quantitative and qualitative differences in phytoplankton species composition may lead to pronounced differences in bacterioplankton species composition.},
