abstract: 'Summary 1. We used flow cytometry to characterize freshwater photosynthetic
  picoplankton (PPP) and heterotrophic bacteria (HB) in Lake Kivu, one of the East-African
  great lakes. Throughout three cruises run in different seasons, covering the four
  major basins, phycoerythrin-rich cells dominated the PPP. Heterotrophic bacteria
  and PPP cell numbers were always high and spatial variations were modest. This represents
  an important difference from temperate and high latitude lakes that show high fluctuations
  in cell abundance over an annual cycle.  2. Three populations of picocyanobacteria
  were identified: one corresponded to single-cells (identified as Synechococcus by
  epifluorescence microscopy, molecular methods and pigment content), and the two
  other that most probably correspond to two and four celled colonies of the same
  taxon. The proportion of these two subpopulations was greater under stratified conditions,
  with stronger nutrient limitation.   3. High PPP concentrations ( c. 10 5 cell mL
  −1 ) relative to HB ( c. 10 6 cell mL −1 ) were always found. Lake Kivu supports
  relatively less bacteria than phytoplankton biomass than temperate systems, probably
  as a consequence of factors such as temperature, oligotrophy, nutrient limitation
  and trophic structure.   4. A review of PPP concentration across aquatic systems
  suggests that the abundance of Synechococcus -like cyanobacteria in large, oligotrophic,
  tropical lakes is very high.  5. Photosynthetic picoplankton cell abundances in
  the oligotrophic tropical lakes Kivu and Tanganyika are comparable to those of eutrophic
  temperate lakes. This apparently contradicts the view that PPP abundance increases
  with increasing eutrophy. More data on PPP in tropical lakes are needed to explore
  further this particular pattern.'
