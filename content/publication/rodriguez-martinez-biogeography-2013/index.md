abstract: Abstract The MAST-4 (marine stramenopile group 4) is a widespread uncultured
  picoeukaryote that makes up an important fraction of marine heterotrophic flagellates.
  This group has low genetic divergence and is composed of a small number of putative
  species. We combined ARISA (automated ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis) and
  ITS (Internal Transcribed Spacer) clone libraries to study the biogeography of this
  marine protist, examining both spatial and temporal trends in MAST-4 assemblages
  and associated environmental factors. The most represented MAST-4 clades appeared
  adapted to different temperature ranges, and their distributions did not suggest
  clear geographical barriers for dispersal. Distant samples sharing the same temperature
  had very similar assemblages, especially in cold temperatures, where only one clade,
  E1, dominated. The most highly represented clades, A and E1, showed very little
  differentiation between populations from distant geographical regions. Within a
  single site, temporal variation also followed patterns governed by temperature.
  Our results contribute to the general discussion on microbial biogeography by showing
  strong environmental selection for some picoeukaryotes in the marine environment.
