abstract: The taxonomic position of Blastodinium navicula Chatton and B. contortum
  Chatton, parasites of marine copepods, was investigated on the basis of morphological
  observations and molecular data. The life cycle of Blastodinium includes a parasitic
  stage, a trophont, and free‐swimming dinospores. The individual cells in the trophont,
  as well as the dinospores that they produced, were thecate. Dinospores of B. contortum
  and B .  navicula had peridinioid plate tabulation formula, demonstrating an affiliation
  to the order Peridiniales Heackel (subdivision Dinokaryota Fensome et al.). This
  systematic position is in contrast to current classifications, in which the order
  Blastodiniales Chatton is thought to represent an early evolutionary branch of the
  dinokaryote lineage. Small‐subunit rRNA gene sequences were generated from six Blastodinium
  individuals isolated from three different host species. In phylogenetic analyses
  based on SSU rRNA genes, Blastodinium spp. branched with the typical dinoflagellates.
  Even though overall statistical support was low, the analyses suggested that Blastodinium
  spp. are late‐branching, dinokaryote dinoflagellates. Species currently included
  in Blastodiniales are all parasites, but they are morphologically and functionally
  diverse. Emerging molecular data also reveal high genetic diversity, and therefore,
  the taxonomy of the group requires reevaluation.
