abstract: 'Testing hypothesis about the biogeography of genes using large data resources
  such as Tara Oceans marine metagenomes and metatranscriptomes requires significant
  hardware resources and programming skills. The new release of the ‘Ocean Gene Atlas’
  (OGA2) is a freely available intuitive online service to mine large and complex
  marine environmental genomic databases. OGA2 datasets available have been extended
  and now include, from the Tara Oceans portfolio: (i) eukaryotic Metagenome-Assembled-Genomes
  (MAGs) and Single-cell Assembled Genomes (SAGs) (10.2E+6 coding genes), (ii) version
  2 of Ocean Microbial Reference Gene Catalogue (46.8E+6 non-redundant genes), (iii)
  924 MetaGenomic Transcriptomes (7E+6 unigenes), (iv) 530 MAGs from an Arctic MAG
  catalogue (1E+6 genes) and (v) 1888 Bacterial and Archaeal Genomes (4.5E+6 genes),
  and an additional dataset from the Malaspina 2010 global circumnavigation: (vi)
  317 Malaspina Deep Metagenome Assembled Genomes (0.9E+6 genes). Novel analyses enabled
  by OGA2 include phylogenetic tree inference to visualize user queries within their
  context of sequence homologues from both the marine environmental dataset and the
  RefSeq database. An Application Programming Interface (API) now allows users to
  query OGA2 using command-line tools, hence providing local workflow integration.
  Finally, gene abundance can be interactively filtered directly on map displays using
  any of the available environmental variables. Ocean Gene Atlas v2.0 is freely-available
