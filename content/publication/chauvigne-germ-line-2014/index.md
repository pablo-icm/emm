abstract: Significance In vertebrates, the transition of postmeiotic spermatids into
  spermatozoa (spermiogenesis) is believed to occur indirectly in response to androgens
  released by the somatic Leydig cells after activation of the luteinizing hormone/choriogonadotropin
  receptor (LHCGR). In contrast to this indirect model, here we show that distantly
  related fishes express the homolog of the tetrapod LHCGR (Lhcgrba) also in germ
  cells, which directly drives spermiogenesis in response to the luteinizing hormone.
  Our findings reveal a nonsteroidal role of the Lhcgrba pathway in vertebrate germ
  cells with potential implications for the causes of male infertility. ,  In both
  mammals and teleosts, the differentiation of postmeiotic spermatids to spermatozoa
  (spermiogenesis) is thought to be indirectly controlled by the luteinizing hormone
  (LH) acting through the LH/choriogonadotropin receptor (LHCGR) to stimulate androgen
  secretion in the interstitial Leydig cells. However, a more direct, nonsteroidal
  role of LH mediating the spermiogenic pathway remains unclear. Using a flatfish
  with semicystic spermatogenesis, in which spermatids are released into the seminiferous
  lobule lumen (SLL), where they develop into spermatozoa without direct contact with
  the supporting Sertoli cells, we show that haploid spermatids express the homolog
  of the tetrapod LHCGR (Lhcgrba). Both native Lh and intramuscularly injected His-tagged
  recombinant Lh (rLh) are immunodetected bound to the Lhcgrba of free spermatids
  in the SLL, showing that circulating gonadotropin can reach the intratubular compartment.
  In vitro incubation of flatfish spermatids isolated from the SLL with rLh specifically
  promotes their differentiation into spermatozoa, whereas recombinant follicle-stimulating
  hormone and steroid hormones are ineffective. Using a repertoire of molecular markers
  and inhibitors, we find that the Lh-Lhcgrba induction of spermiogenesis is mediated
  through a cAMP/PKA signaling pathway that initiates the transcription of genes potentially
  involved in the function of spermatozoa. We further show that Lhcgrba expression
  in germ cells also occurs in distantly related fishes, suggesting this feature is
  likely conserved in teleosts regardless of the type of germ cell development. These
  data reveal a role of LH in vertebrate germ cells, whereby a Lhcgrba-activated signaling
  cascade in haploid spermatids directs gene expression and the progression of spermiogenesis.
