abstract: ABSTRACT  We tested the sensitivity of coastal picophytoplankton exposed
  to natural sunlight in short-term experiments. Cell abundance and cell-specific
  chlorophyll fluorescence were significantly reduced in Prochlorococcus spp. but
  not in Synechococcus , whereas picoeukaryotes had an intermediate response. These
  results are the first direct evidence of a differential sensitivity to sunlight
  of these ubiquitous marine members of unicellular phytoplankton.
