Catalysed reporter deposition–fluorescence
in situ
hybridization (
CARD‐FISH
) is a powerful approach to quantify bacterial taxa.

n this study, we compare the performance of the widely used

probe with the new
CF
968 probe.
In silico
analyses and tests with isolates demonstrate that

hybridizes with non‐

sequences from the

families. We test the probes’ accuracy in 37 globally distributed marine samples and over two consecutive years at the

data with the

gene sequences retrieved from 27 marine metagenomes from the
TARA
Oceans expedition. We find no significant differences in abundances between both approaches, although
CF

targeted some unspecific sequences and both probes displayed different abundances of specific

phylotypes. Our results demonstrate that quantitative estimations by using both probes are significantly different in certain oceanographic regions (

editerranean Sea,
R

A
rabian Sea) and that
CF
968 shows seasonality within marine

. We propose
CF
968 as an alternative to

for targeting the whole
