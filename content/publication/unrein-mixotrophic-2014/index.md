abstract: 'Abstract Grazing rate estimates indicate that approximately half of the
  bacterivory in oligotrophic oceans is due to mixotrophic flagellates (MFs). However,
  most estimations have considered algae as a single group. Here we aimed at opening
  the black-box of the phytoflagellates (PFs) &lt;20 μm. Haptophytes, chlorophytes,
  cryptophytes and pigmented dinoflagellates were identified using fluorescent in
  situ hybridization or by standard 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole staining. Their
  fluctuations in abundance, cell size, biomass and bacterivory rates were measured
  through an annual cycle in an oligotrophic coastal system. On average, we were able
  to assign to these groups: 37% of the total pico-PFs and 65% of the nano-PFs composition.
  Chlorophytes were mostly picoplanktonic and they never ingested fluorescently labeled
  bacteria. About 50% of the PF &lt;20 μm biomass was represented by mixotrophic algae.
  Pigmented dinoflagellates were the least abundant group with little impact on bacterioplankton.
  Cryptophytes were quantitatively important during the coldest periods and explained
  about 4% of total bacterivory. Haptophytes were the most important mixotrophic group:
  (i) they were mostly represented by cells 3–5 μm in size present year-round; (ii)
  cell-specific grazing rates were comparable to those of other bacterivorous non-photosynthetic
  organisms, regardless of the in situ nutrient availability conditions; (iii) these
  organisms could acquire a significant portion of their carbon by ingesting bacteria;
  and (iv) haptophytes explained on average 40% of the bacterivory exerted by MFs
  and were responsible for 9–27% of total bacterivory at this site. Our results, when
  considered alongside the widespread distribution of haptophytes in the ocean, indicate
  that they have a key role as bacterivores in marine ecosystems.'
