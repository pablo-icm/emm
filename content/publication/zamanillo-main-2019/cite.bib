 abstract = {Abstract. Transparent exopolymer particles (TEPs) are a class of gel
particles, produced mainly by microorganisms, which play important roles in
biogeochemical processes such as carbon cycling and export. TEPs (a) are
colonized by carbon-consuming microbes; (b) mediate aggregation and sinking
of organic matter and organisms, thereby contributing to the biological
carbon pump; and (c) accumulate in the surface microlayer (SML) and affect
air–sea gas exchange. The first step to evaluate the global influence of
TEPs in these processes is the prediction of TEP occurrence in the ocean.
Yet, little is known about the physical and biological variables that drive
their abundance, particularly in the open ocean. Here we describe the
horizontal TEP distribution, along with physical and biological variables, in
surface waters along a north–south transect in the Atlantic Ocean during
October–November 2014. Two main regions were separated due to remarkable
differences: the open Atlantic Ocean (OAO, n=30), and the Southwestern
Atlantic Shelf (SWAS, n=10). TEP concentration in the entire transect
ranged 18.3–446.8 µg XG eq L−1 and averaged 117.1±119.8 µg XG eq L−1, with the maximum concentrations in the
SWAS and in a station located at the edge of the Canary Coastal Upwelling
(CU), and the highest TEP to chlorophyll a (TEP:Chl a)
ratios in the OAO (183±56) and CU (1760). TEPs were significantly and
positively related to Chl a and phytoplankton biomass, expressed in terms
of C, along the entire transect. In the OAO, TEPs were positively related to
some phytoplankton groups, mainly Synechococcus. They were
negatively related to the previous 24 h averaged solar irradiance,
suggesting that sunlight, particularly UV radiation, is more a sink than a
source for TEP. Multiple regression analyses showed the combined positive
effect of phytoplankton and heterotrophic prokaryotes (HPs) on TEP
distribution in the OAO. In the SWAS, TEPs were positively related to high
nucleic acid-containing prokaryotic cells and total phytoplankton biomass,
but not to any particular phytoplankton group. Estimated TEP–carbon
constituted an important portion of the particulate organic carbon pool in
the entire transect (28 %–110 %), generally higher than the
phytoplankton and HP carbon shares, which highlights the importance of TEPs
in the cycling of organic matter in the ocean.},
