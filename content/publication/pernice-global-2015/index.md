abstract: Abstract The dark ocean is one of the largest biomes on Earth, with critical
  roles in organic matter remineralization and global carbon sequestration. Despite
  its recognized importance, little is known about some key microbial players, such
  as the community of heterotrophic protists (HP), which are likely the main consumers
  of prokaryotic biomass. To investigate this microbial component at a global scale,
  we determined their abundance and biomass in deepwater column samples from the Malaspina
  2010 circumnavigation using a combination of epifluorescence microscopy and flow
  cytometry. HP were ubiquitously found at all depths investigated down to 4000 m.
  HP abundances decreased with depth, from an average of 72±19 cells ml−1 in mesopelagic
  waters down to 11±1 cells ml−1 in bathypelagic waters, whereas their total biomass
  decreased from 280±46 to 50±14 pg C ml−1. The parameters that better explained the
  variance of HP abundance were depth and prokaryote abundance, and to lesser extent
  oxygen concentration. The generally good correlation with prokaryotic abundance
  suggested active grazing of HP on prokaryotes. On a finer scale, the prokaryote:HP
  abundance ratio varied at a regional scale, and sites with the highest ratios exhibited
  a larger contribution of fungi molecular signal. Our study is a step forward towards
  determining the relationship between HP and their environment, unveiling their importance
  as players in the dark ocean’s microbial food web.
