abstract: Abstract. Microbial plankton experience short-term fluctuations in total
  solar irradiance and in its spectral composition as they are vertically moved by
  turbulence in the oceanic upper mixed layer (UML). The fact that the light exposure
  is not static but dynamic may have important consequences for biogeochemical processes
  and ocean–atmosphere fluxes. However, most biogeochemical processes other than primary
  production, like bacterial production or dimethylsulfide (DMS) production, are seldom
  measured in sunlight and even less often in dynamic light fields. We conducted four
  experiments in oligotrophic summer stratified Mediterranean waters, where a sample
  from the UML was incubated in ultraviolet (UV)-transparent bottles at three fixed
  depths within the UML and on a vertically moving basket across the same depth range.
  We assessed the response of the phyto- and bacterioplankton community with physiological
  indicators based on flow cytometry singe-cell measurements, fast repetition rate
  fluorometry (FRRf), phytoplankton pigment concentrations and particulate light absorption.
  Dynamic light exposure caused a subtle disruption of the photoinhibition and photoacclimation
  processes associated with ultraviolet radiation (UVR), which slightly alleviated
  bacterial photoinhibition but did not favor primary production. Gross DMS production
  (GPDMS) decreased sharply with depth in parallel to shortwave UVR, and displayed
  a dose-dependent response that mixing did not significantly disrupt. To our knowledge,
  we provide the first measurements of GPDMS under in situ UV-inclusive optical conditions.
