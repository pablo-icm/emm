 abstract = {Summary
Different factors affect the way dissolved organic matter (DOM) is processed in the ocean water column, including environmental conditions and the functional capabilities of the communities. Recent studies have shown that bathypelagic prokaryotes are metabolically flexible, but whether this versatility translates into a higher ability to process DOM has been barely explored. Here we performed a multifactorial transplant experiment to compare the growth, activity and changes in DOM quality in surface and bathypelagic waters inoculated with either surface or bathypelagic prokaryotic communities. The effect of nutrient additions to surface waters was also explored. Despite no differences in the cell abundance of surface and deep ocean prokaryotes were observed in any of the treatments, in surface waters with nutrients the heterotrophic production of surface prokaryotes rapidly decreased. Conversely, bathypelagic communities displayed a sustained production throughout the experiment. Incubations with surface prokaryotes always led to a significant accumulation of recalcitrant compounds, which did not occur with bathypelagic prokaryotes, suggesting they have a higher ability to process DOM. These contrasting abilities could be explained by the recruitment of a comparatively larger number of opportunistic taxa within the bathypelagic assemblages, which likely resulted in a broader community capability of substrate utilization.},
