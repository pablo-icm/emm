abstract: Summary Different factors affect the way dissolved organic matter (DOM)
  is processed in the ocean water column, including environmental conditions and the
  functional capabilities of the communities. Recent studies have shown that bathypelagic
  prokaryotes are metabolically flexible, but whether this versatility translates
  into a higher ability to process DOM has been barely explored. Here we performed
  a multifactorial transplant experiment to compare the growth, activity and changes
  in DOM quality in surface and bathypelagic waters inoculated with either surface
  or bathypelagic prokaryotic communities. The effect of nutrient additions to surface
  waters was also explored. Despite no differences in the cell abundance of surface
  and deep ocean prokaryotes were observed in any of the treatments, in surface waters
  with nutrients the heterotrophic production of surface prokaryotes rapidly decreased.
  Conversely, bathypelagic communities displayed a sustained production throughout
  the experiment. Incubations with surface prokaryotes always led to a significant
  accumulation of recalcitrant compounds, which did not occur with bathypelagic prokaryotes,
  suggesting they have a higher ability to process DOM. These contrasting abilities
  could be explained by the recruitment of a comparatively larger number of opportunistic
  taxa within the bathypelagic assemblages, which likely resulted in a broader community
  capability of substrate utilization.
