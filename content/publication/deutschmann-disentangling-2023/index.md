abstract: Abstract  Background Microbial interactions are fundamental for Earth’s
  ecosystem functioning and biogeochemical cycling. Nevertheless, they are challenging
  to identify and remain barely known. Omics-based censuses are helpful in predicting
  microbial interactions through the statistical inference of single (static) association
  networks. Yet, microbial interactions are dynamic and we have limited knowledge
  of how they change over time. Here, we investigate the dynamics of microbial associations
  in a 10-year marine time series in the Mediterranean Sea using an approach inferring
  a time-resolved (temporal) network from a single static network.   Results A single
  static network including microbial eukaryotes and bacteria was built using metabarcoding
  data derived from 120 monthly samples. For the decade, we aimed to identify persistent,
  seasonal, and temporary microbial associations by determining a temporal network
  that captures the interactome of each individual sample. We found that the temporal
  network appears to follow an annual cycle, collapsing, and reassembling when transiting
  between colder and warmer waters. We observed higher association repeatability in
  colder than in warmer months. Only 16 associations could be validated using observations
  reported in literature, underlining our knowledge gap in marine microbial ecological
  interactions.   Conclusions Our results indicate that marine microbial associations
  follow recurrent temporal dynamics in temperate zones, which need to be accounted
  for to better understand the functioning of the ocean microbiome. The constructed
  marine temporal network may serve as a resource for testing season-specific microbial
  interaction hypotheses. The applied approach can be transferred to microbiome studies
  in other ecosystems.
