abstract: Two diel cycle studies were conducted to determine the effect of day—night
  light changes on winter bacterial activity in the coastal Mediterranean (Blanes
  Bay Microbial Observatory). Bacterial abundances, bacterial heterotrophic activity,
  and flagellate grazing counts were determined at 4-h intervals during two 3-d periods
  separated by 2 d. Twice a day, the single-cell activity of major bacterial groups
  was further analyzed by applying microautoradiography combined with catalyzed reporter
  deposition—fluorescence in situ hybridization. During the first cycle, all the measured
  parameters (including the number of active cells in most groups) varied synchronously,
  with higher values at night and lower during the day. An episode of strong winds
  between the two studied periods disrupted this periodicity at the onset of the second
  cycle. The bulk incorporation of 3 H-leucine recovered the diel pattern after 2
  d, mostly driven by the activity of Gammaproteobacteria. Among the possibilities
  considered, the observed nighttime increases in the grazing activity of heterotrophic
  nanoflagellates appeared to partially drive the activity of all bacterial taxa through
  potential periodic release of dissolved organic matter.
