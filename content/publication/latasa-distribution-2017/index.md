abstract: 'Abstract  The fine vertical distribution of phytoplankton groups within
  the deep chlorophyll maximum (DCM) was studied in the NE Atlantic during summer
  stratification. A simple but unconventional sampling strategy allowed examining
  the vertical structure with ca. 2 m resolution. The distribution of Prochlorococcus
  , Synechococcus , chlorophytes, pelagophytes, small prymnesiophytes, coccolithophores,
  diatoms, and dinoflagellates was investigated with a combination of pigment-markers,
  flow cytometry and optical and FISH microscopy. All groups presented minimum abundances
  at the surface and a maximum in the DCM layer. The cell distribution was not vertically
  symmetrical around the DCM peak and cells tended to accumulate in the upper part
  of the DCM layer. The more symmetrical distribution of chlorophyll than cells around
  the DCM peak was due to the increase of pigment per cell with depth. We found a
  vertical alignment of phytoplankton groups within the DCM layer indicating preferences
  for different ecological niches in a layer with strong gradients of light and nutrients.
  Prochlorococcus occupied the shallowest and diatoms the deepest layers. Dinoflagellates,
  Synechococcus and small prymnesiophytes preferred shallow DCM layers, and coccolithophores,
  chlorophytes and pelagophytes showed a preference for deep layers. Cell size within
  groups changed with depth in a pattern related to their mean size: the cell volume
  of the smallest group increased the most with depth while the cell volume of the
  largest group decreased the most. The vertical alignment of phytoplankton groups
  confirms that the DCM is not a homogeneous entity and indicates groups’ preferences
  for different ecological niches within this layer.'
