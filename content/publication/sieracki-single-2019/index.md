abstract: Abstract  Marine planktonic protists are critical components of ocean ecosystems
  and are highly diverse. Molecular sequencing methods are being used to describe
  this diversity and reveal new associations and metabolisms that are important to
  how these ecosystems function. We describe here the use of the single cell genomics
  approach to sample and interrogate the diversity of the smaller (pico- and nano-sized)
  protists from a range of oceanic samples. We created over 900 single amplified genomes
  (SAGs) from 8 Tara Ocean samples across the Indian Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea.
  We show that flow cytometric sorting of single cells effectively distinguishes plastidic
  and aplastidic cell types that agree with our understanding of protist phylogeny.
  Yields of genomic DNA with PCR-identifiable 18S rRNA gene sequence from single cells
  was low (15% of aplastidic cell sorts, and 7% of plastidic sorts) and tests with
  alternate primers and comparisons to metabarcoding did not reveal phylogenetic bias
  in the major protist groups. There was little evidence of significant bias against
  or in favor of any phylogenetic group expected or known to be present. The four
  open ocean stations in the Indian Ocean had similar communities, despite ranging
  from 14°N to 20°S latitude, and they differed from the Mediterranean station. Single
  cell genomics of protists suggests that the taxonomic diversity of the dominant
  taxa found in only several hundreds of microliters of surface seawater is similar
  to that found in molecular surveys where liters of sample are filtered.
