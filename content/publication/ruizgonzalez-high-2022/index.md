abstract: Abstract Subterranean estuaries are biogeochemically active coastal sites
  resulting from the underground mixing of fresh aquifer groundwater and seawater.
  In these systems, microbial activity can largely transform the chemical elements
  that may reach the sea through submarine groundwater discharge (SGD), but little
  is known about the microorganisms thriving in these land‐sea transition zones. We
  present the first spatially‐resolved characterization of the bacterial assemblages
  along a coastal aquifer in the NW Mediterranean, considering the entire subsurface
  salinity gradient. Combining bulk heterotrophic activity measurements, flow cytometry,
  microscopy and 16S rRNA gene sequencing we find large variations in prokaryotic
  abundances, cell size, activity and diversity at both the horizontal and vertical
  scales that reflect the pronounced physicochemical gradients. The parts of the transect
  most influenced by freshwater were characterized by smaller cells and lower prokaryotic
  abundances and heterotrophic production, but some activity hotspots were found at
  deep low‐oxygen saline groundwater sites enriched in nitrite and ammonium. Diverse,
  heterogeneous and highly endemic communities dominated by Proteobacteria, Patescibacteria,
  Desulfobacterota and Bacteroidota were observed throughout the aquifer, pointing
  to clearly differentiated prokaryotic niches across these transition zones and little
  microbial connectivity between groundwater and Mediterranean seawater habitats.
  Finally, experimental manipulations unveiled large increases in community heterotrophic
  activity driven by fast growth of some rare and site‐specific groundwater Proteobacteria.
  Our results indicate that prokaryotic communities within subterranean estuaries
  are highly heterogeneous in terms of biomass, activity and diversity, suggesting
  that their role in transforming nutrients will also vary spatially within these
  terrestrial–marine transition zones.
