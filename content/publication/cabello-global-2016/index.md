abstract: Abstract A marine symbiosis has been recently discovered between prymnesiophyte
  species and the unicellular diazotrophic cyanobacterium UCYN-A. At least two different
  UCYN-A phylotypes exist, the clade UCYN-A1 in symbiosis with an uncultured small
  prymnesiophyte and the clade UCYN-A2 in symbiosis with the larger Braarudosphaera
  bigelowii. We targeted the prymnesiophyte–UCYN-A1 symbiosis by double CARD-FISH
  (catalyzed reporter deposition-fluorescence in situ hybridization) and analyzed
  its abundance in surface samples from the MALASPINA circumnavigation expedition.
  Our use of a specific probe for the prymnesiophyte partner allowed us to verify
  that this algal species virtually always carried the UCYN-A symbiont, indicating
  that the association was also obligate for the host. The prymnesiophyte–UCYN-A1
  symbiosis was detected in all ocean basins, displaying a patchy distribution with
  abundances (up to 500 cells ml−1) that could vary orders of magnitude. Additional
  vertical profiles taken at the NE Atlantic showed that this symbiosis occupied the
  upper water column and disappeared towards the Deep Chlorophyll Maximum, where the
  biomass of the prymnesiophyte assemblage peaked. Moreover, sequences of both prymnesiophyte
  partners were searched within a large 18S rDNA metabarcoding data set from the Tara-Oceans
  expedition around the world. This sequence-based analysis supported the patchy distribution
  of the UCYN-A1 host observed by CARD-FISH and highlighted an unexpected homogeneous
  distribution (at low relative abundance) of B. bigelowii in the open ocean. Our
  results demonstrate that partners are always in symbiosis in nature and show contrasted
  ecological patterns of the two related lineages.
