abstract: Abstract Mixotrophs combine photosynthesis with phagotrophy to cover their
  demands in energy and essential nutrients. This gives them a competitive advantage
  under oligotropihc conditions, where nutrients and bacteria concentrations are low.
  As the advantage for the mixotroph depends on light, the competition between mixo-
  and heterotrophic bacterivores should be regulated by light. To test this hypothesis,
  we incubated natural plankton from the ultra-oligotrophic Eastern Mediterranean
  in a set of mesocosms maintained at 4 light levels spanning a 10-fold light gradient.
  Picoplankton (heterotrophic bacteria (HB), pico-sized cyanobacteria, and small-sized
  flagellates) showed the fastest and most marked response to light, with pronounced
  predator-prey cycles, in the high-light treatments. Albeit cell specific activity
  of heterotrophic bacteria was constant across the light gradient, bacterial abundances
  exhibited an inverse relationship with light. This pattern was explained by light-induced
  top-down control of HB by bacterivorous phototrophic eukaryotes (PE), which was
  evidenced by a significant inverse relationship between HB net growth rate and PE
  abundances. Our results show that light mediates the impact of mixotrophic bacterivores.
  As mixo- and heterotrophs differ in the way they remineralize nutrients, these results
  have far-reaching implications for how nutrient cycling is affected by light.
