abstract: Abstract Determining the factors that influence marine microbial growth
  and community structure are critical for the understanding of global carbon cycling.
  Since the early twentieth century, it has been known that B vitamins play an important
  role in phytoplankton community dynamics. Limited oceanic dissolved B vitamin distributions
  indicate that these important coenzymes are present at picomolar levels, which could
  be too low to support maximal phytoplankton growth, and vast regions of the ocean
  exist where they are undetectable. Despite their importance, particulate B vitamin
  concentrations of field microbial populations are unknown. Here we report B vitamin
  concentrations measured in both the particulate and dissolved fractions, including
  multiple biochemically relevant B vitamin congeners. We establish their spatial
  distributions spanning distinct biogeographic and oceanographic regimes in the Mediterranean
  Sea and the Eastern Atlantic Ocean and show that all congeners are present both
  dissolved in seawater and in suspended particles. We observe that B vitamins cooccur
  in patches defined by regional biogeographic and oceanographic features. Additionally,
  distinct patterns of congener relative abundance in the dissolved and particulate
  pools provide insight to biological and chemical cycling of these compounds between
  and within the dissolved and particulate pools. Finally, linear model results demonstrate
  that model fits of microbial assemblages are strongest when they include both inorganic
  nutrients and dissolved B vitamin concentrations. We believe that these findings
  represent an advance in our understanding of B vitamin oceanographic distributions
  and point to interesting hypotheses of their influence on marine microbial ecology.
