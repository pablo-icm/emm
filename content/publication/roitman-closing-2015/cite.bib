Marine photosynthesis is largely driven by cyanobacteria, namely

S
ynechococcus

and

P
rochlorococcus

. Genes encoding for photosystem (
PS
)
I
and
II
reaction centre proteins are found in cyanophages and are believed to increase their fitness. Two viral
PSI
gene arrangements are known,

E

D

and

psaD→
C
→A→
B

. The shared genes between these gene cassettes and their encoded proteins are distinguished by %G + 
C
and protein sequence respectively. The data on the

psaD→
C
→A→
B

gene organization were reported from only two partial gene cassettes coming from Global Ocean Sampling stations in the
P
acific and
I
ndian oceans. Now we have extended our search to 370 marine stations from six metagenomic projects. Genes corresponding to both
PSI
gene arrangements were detected in the
P
acific,
I
ndian and
A
tlantic oceans, confined to a strip along the equator (30°N and 30°S). In addition, we found that the predicted structure of the viral
PsaA
protein from the

psaD→
C
→
A
→
B

organization contains a lumenal loop conserved in
PsaA
proteins from

S
ynechococcus

, but is completely absent in viral
PsaA
proteins from the

gene organization and most

strains. This may indicate a co‐evolutionary scenario where cyanophages containing either of these gene organizations infect cyanobacterial ecotypes biogeographically restricted to the 30°N and 30°S equatorial strip.},
