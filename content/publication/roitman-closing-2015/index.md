abstract: Summary  Marine photosynthesis is largely driven by cyanobacteria, namely  S
  ynechococcus  and  P rochlorococcus  . Genes encoding for photosystem ( PS ) I and
  II reaction centre proteins are found in cyanophages and are believed to increase
  their fitness. Two viral PSI gene arrangements are known,  psaJF→ C →A→ B → K →
  E → D  and  psaD→ C →A→ B  . The shared genes between these gene cassettes and their
  encoded proteins are distinguished by %G +  C and protein sequence respectively.
  The data on the  psaD→ C →A→ B  gene organization were reported from only two partial
  gene cassettes coming from Global Ocean Sampling stations in the P acific and I
  ndian oceans. Now we have extended our search to 370 marine stations from six metagenomic
  projects. Genes corresponding to both PSI gene arrangements were detected in the
  P acific, I ndian and A tlantic oceans, confined to a strip along the equator (30°N
  and 30°S). In addition, we found that the predicted structure of the viral PsaA
  protein from the  psaD→ C → A → B  organization contains a lumenal loop conserved
  in PsaA proteins from  S ynechococcus  , but is completely absent in viral PsaA
  proteins from the  psaJF→ C → A → B → K → E → D  gene organization and most  P rochlorococcus  strains.
  This may indicate a co‐evolutionary scenario where cyanophages containing either
  of these gene organizations infect cyanobacterial ecotypes biogeographically restricted
  to the 30°N and 30°S equatorial strip.
