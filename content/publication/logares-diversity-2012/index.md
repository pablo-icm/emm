abstract: Abstract Flagellated heterotrophic microeukaryotes have key roles for the
  functioning of marine ecosystems as they channel large amounts of organic carbon
  to the upper trophic levels and control the population sizes of bacteria and archaea.
  Still, we know very little on the diversity patterns of most groups constituting
  this evolutionary heterogeneous assemblage. Here, we investigate 11 groups of uncultured
  flagellates known as MArine STramenopiles (MASTs). MASTs are ecologically very important
  and branch at the base of stramenopiles. We explored the diversity patterns of MASTs
  using pyrosequencing (18S rDNA) in coastal European waters. We found that MAST groups
  range from highly to lowly diversified. Pyrosequencing (hereafter ‘454’) allowed
  us to approach to the limits of taxonomic diversity for all MAST groups, which varied
  in one order of magnitude (tens to hundreds) in terms of operational taxonomic units
  (98% similarity). We did not evidence large differences in activity, as indicated
  by ratios of DNA:RNA-reads. Most groups were strictly planktonic, although we found
  some groups that were active in sediments and even in anoxic waters. The proportion
  of reads per size fraction indicated that most groups were composed of very small
  cells (∼2–5 μm). In addition, phylogenetically different assemblages appeared to
  be present in different size fractions, depths and geographic zones. Thus, MAST
  diversity seems to be highly partitioned in spatial scales. Altogether, our results
  shed light on these ecologically very important but poorly known groups of uncultured
  marine flagellates.
