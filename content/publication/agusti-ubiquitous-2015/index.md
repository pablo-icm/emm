abstract: Abstract  The role of the ocean as a sink for CO 2 is partially dependent
  on the downward transport of phytoplankton cells packaged within fast-sinking particles.
  However, whether such fast-sinking mechanisms deliver fresh organic carbon down
  to the deep bathypelagic sea and whether this mechanism is prevalent across the
  ocean requires confirmation. Here we report the ubiquitous presence of healthy photosynthetic
  cells, dominated by diatoms, down to 4,000 m in the deep dark ocean. Decay experiments
  with surface phytoplankton suggested that the large proportion (18%) of healthy
  photosynthetic cells observed, on average, in the dark ocean, requires transport
  times from a few days to a few weeks, corresponding to sinking rates (124–732 m d
  −1 ) comparable to those of fast-sinking aggregates and faecal pellets. These results
  confirm the expectation that fast-sinking mechanisms inject fresh organic carbon
  into the deep sea and that this is a prevalent process operating across the global
  oligotrophic ocean.
