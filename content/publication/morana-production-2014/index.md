abstract: 'In pelagic ecosystems, phytoplankton extracellular release can extensively
  subsidize the heterotrophic prokaryotic carbon demand. Time-course experiments were
  carried out to quantify primary production, phytoplankton excretion, and the microbial
  uptake of freshly released dissolved organic carbon (DOC) derived from phytoplankton
  extracellular release (DOCp) in four large tropical lakes distributed along a productivity
  gradient: Kivu, Edward, Albert, and Victoria. The contributions of the major heterotrophic
  bacterial groups to the uptake of DOCp was also analyzed in Lake Kivu, using microautoradiography
  coupled to catalyzed reporter deposition fluorescent in situ hybridization. The
  percentage of extracellular release (PER) varied across the productivity gradient,
  with higher values at low productivity. Furthermore, PER was significantly related
  to high light and low phosphate concentrations in the mixed layer and was comparatively
  higher in oligotrophic tropical lakes than in their temperate counterparts. Both
  observations suggest that environmental factors play a key role in the control of
  phytoplankton excretion. Standing stocks of DOCp were small and generally contributed
  less than 1% to the total DOC because it was rapidly assimilated by prokaryotes.
  In other words, there was a tight coupling between the production and the heterotrophic
  consumption of DOCp. None of the major phylogenetic bacterial groups that were investigated
  differed in their ability to take up DOCp, in contrast with earlier results reported
  for standard labeled single-molecule substrates (leucine, glucose, adenosine triphosphate).
  It supports the idea that the metabolic ability to use DOCp is widespread among
  heterotrophic prokaryotes. Overall, these results highlight the importance of carbon
  transfer between phytoplankton and bacterioplankton in large African lakes.'
