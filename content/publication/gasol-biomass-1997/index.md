abstract: 'Patterns in primary production and carbon export from the euphotic zone
  suggest that the relative contribution of planktonic heterotrophs to community biomass
  should decline along gradients of phytoplankton biomass and primary production.
  Here, we use an extensive literature data survey to test the hypothesis that the
  ratio of total heterotrophic (bacteria + protozoa + mesozooplankton) biomass to
  total autotrophic biomass (H : A ratio) is not constant in marine plankton communities
  but rather tends to decline with increasing phytoplankton biomass and primary production.
  Our results show that the plankton of unproductive regions are characterized by
  very high relative heterotrophic biomasses resulting in inverted biomass pyramids,
  whereas the plankton of productive areas are characterized by a smaller contribution
  of heterotrophs to community biomass and a normal biomass pyramid with a broad autotrophic
  base. Moreover, open‐ocean communities support significantly more heterotrophic
  biomass in the upper layers than do coastal communities for a given autotrophic
  biomass. These differences in the biomass structure of the community could be explained
  by the changes in the biomass‐specific rates of phytoplankton production that seem
  to occur from ultraoligotrophic to eutrophic marine regions, but other factors could
  also generate them. The patterns described suggest a rather systematic shift from
  consumer control of primary production and phytoplankton biomass in open ocean to
  resource control in upwelling and coastal areas.'
