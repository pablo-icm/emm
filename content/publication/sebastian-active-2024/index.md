abstract: Abstract A persistent microbial seed bank is postulated to sustain the marine
  biosphere, and recent findings show that prokaryotic taxa present in the ocean’s
  surface dominate prokaryotic communities throughout the water column. Yet, environmental
  conditions exert a tight control on the activity of prokaryotes, and drastic changes
  in these conditions are known to occur from the surface to deep waters. The simultaneous
  characterization of the total (DNA) and active (i.e. with potential for protein
  synthesis, RNA) free-living communities in 13 stations distributed across the tropical
  and subtropical global ocean allowed us to assess their change in structure and
  diversity along the water column. We observed that active communities were surprisingly
  more similar along the vertical gradient than total communities. Looking at the
  vertical connectivity of the active vs. the total communities, we found that taxa
  detected in the surface sometimes accounted for more than 75% of the active microbiome
  of bathypelagic waters (50% on average). These active taxa were generally rare in
  the surface, representing a small fraction of all the surface taxa. Our findings
  show that the drastic vertical change in environmental conditions leads to the inactivation
  and disappearance of a large proportion of surface taxa, but some surface-rare taxa
  remain active (or with potential for protein synthesis) and dominate the bathypelagic
  active microbiome.
