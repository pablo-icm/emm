abstract: A bacterial endosymbiont of marine algae evolved to an organelle ,   Eukaryotic
  cells are notably complex—for example, they have various organelles, which are membrane-bound
  structures with specific functions. Two of these organelles, mitochondria and chloroplasts,
  which function in respiration and photosynthesis, evolved from the integration of
  endosymbiotic bacteria to the eukaryotic cell (  1  ). In marine systems, some nitrogen-fixing
  bacteria are endosymbionts of microalgae, such as Candidatus Atelocyanobacterium
  thalassa (UCYN-A), a cyanobacterial symbiont of the unicellular algae Braarudosphaera
  bigelowii (  2  ). On page 217 of this issue, Coale et al . (  3  ) report a close
  integration of the endosymbiont into the architecture and function of the host cell,
  which is a characteristic of organelles. These findings show that UCYN-A has evolved
  from a symbiont to a eukaryotic organelle for nitrogen fixation—the nitroplast—thereby
  expanding a function that was thought to be exclusively carried out by prokaryotic
  cells to eukaryotes.
