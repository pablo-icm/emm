abstract: ABSTRACT    Aerobic anoxygenic phototrophic (AAP) bacteria harvest light
  energy using bacteriochlorophyll-containing reaction centers to supplement their
  mostly heterotrophic metabolism. While their abundance and growth have been intensively
  studied in coastal environments, much less is known about their activity in oligotrophic
  open ocean regions. Therefore, we combined in situ sampling in the North Pacific
  Subtropical Gyre, north of O'ahu island, Hawaii, with two manipulation experiments.
  Infra-red epifluorescence microscopy documented that AAP bacteria represented approximately
  2% of total bacteria in the euphotic zone with the maximum abundance in the upper
  50 m. They conducted active photosynthetic electron transport with maximum rates
  up to 50 electrons per reaction center per second. The in situ decline of bacteriochlorophyll
  concentration over the daylight period, an estimate of loss rates due to predation,
  indicated that the AAP bacteria in the upper 50 m of the water column turned over
  at rates of 0.75–0.90 d −1 . This corresponded well with the specific growth rate
  determined in dilution experiments where AAP bacteria grew at a rate 1.05 ± 0.09
  d −1 . An amendment of inorganic nitrogen to obtain N:P = 32 resulted in a more
  than 10 times increase in AAP abundance over 6 days. The presented data document
  that AAP bacteria are an active part of the bacterioplankton community in the oligotrophic
  North Pacific Subtropical Gyre and that their growth was mostly controlled by nitrogen
  availability and grazing pressure.   IMPORTANCE Marine bacteria represent a complex
  assembly of species with different physiology, metabolism, and substrate preferences.
  We focus on a specific functional group of marine bacteria called aerobic anoxygenic
  phototrophs. These photoheterotrophic organisms require organic carbon substrates
  for growth, but they can also supplement their metabolic needs with light energy
  captured by bacteriochlorophyll. These bacteria have been intensively studied in
  coastal regions, but rather less is known about their distribution, growth, and
  mortality in the oligotrophic open ocean. Therefore, we conducted a suite of measurements
  in the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre to determine the distribution of these organisms
  in the water column and their growth and mortality rates. A nutrient amendment experiment
  showed that aerobic anoxygenic phototrophs were limited by inorganic nitrogen. Despite
  this, they grew more rapidly than average heterotrophic bacteria, but their growth
  was balanced by intense grazing pressure.   ,  Marine bacteria represent a complex
