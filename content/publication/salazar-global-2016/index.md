abstract: Abstract The deep-sea is the largest biome of the biosphere, and contains
  more than half of the whole ocean’s microbes. Uncovering their general patterns
  of diversity and community structure at a global scale remains a great challenge,
  as only fragmentary information of deep-sea microbial diversity exists based on
  regional-scale studies. Here we report the first globally comprehensive survey of
  the prokaryotic communities inhabiting the bathypelagic ocean using high-throughput
  sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. This work identifies the dominant prokaryotes in
  the pelagic deep ocean and reveals that 50% of the operational taxonomic units (OTUs)
  belong to previously unknown prokaryotic taxa, most of which are rare and appear
  in just a few samples. We show that whereas the local richness of communities is
  comparable to that observed in previous regional studies, the global pool of prokaryotic
  taxa detected is modest (~3600 OTUs), as a high proportion of OTUs are shared among
  samples. The water masses appear to act as clear drivers of the geographical distribution
  of both particle-attached and free-living prokaryotes. In addition, we show that
  the deep-oceanic basins in which the bathypelagic realm is divided contain different
  particle-attached (but not free-living) microbial communities. The combination of
  the aging of the water masses and a lack of complete dispersal are identified as
  the main drivers for this biogeographical pattern. All together, we identify the
  potential of the deep ocean as a reservoir of still unknown biological diversity
  with a higher degree of spatial complexity than hitherto considered.
