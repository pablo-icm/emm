abstract: Abstract  Background Viruses play important roles in the ocean’s biogeochemical
  cycles. Yet, deep ocean viruses are one of the most under-explored fractions of
  the global biosphere. Little is known about the environmental factors that control
  the composition and functioning of their communities or how they interact with their
  free-living or particle-attached microbial hosts.   Results We analysed 58 viral
  communities associated with size-fractionated free-living (0.2–0.8 μm) and particle-attached
  (0.8–20 μm) cellular metagenomes from bathypelagic (2150–4018 m deep) microbiomes
  obtained during the Malaspina expedition. These metagenomes yielded 6631 viral sequences,
  91% of which were novel, and 67 represented high-quality genomes. Taxonomic classification
  assigned 53% of the viral sequences to families of tailed viruses from the order
  Caudovirales. Computational host prediction associated 886 viral sequences to dominant
  members of the deep ocean microbiome, such as Alphaproteobacteria (284), Gammaproteobacteria
  (241), SAR324 (23), Marinisomatota (39), and Chloroflexota (61). Free-living and
  particle-attached viral communities had markedly distinct taxonomic composition,
  host prevalence, and auxiliary metabolic gene content, which led to the discovery
  of novel viral-encoded metabolic genes involved in the folate and nucleotide metabolisms.
  Water mass age emerged as an important factor driving viral community composition.
  We postulated this was due to changes in quality and concentration of dissolved
  organic matter acting on the host communities, leading to an increase of viral auxiliary
  metabolic genes associated with energy metabolism among older water masses.   Conclusions
  These results shed light on the mechanisms by which environmental gradients of deep
  ocean ecosystems structure the composition and functioning of free-living and particle-attached
  viral communities.
