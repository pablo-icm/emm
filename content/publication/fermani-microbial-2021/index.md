abstract: ABSTRACT East African Great Lakes are old and unique natural resources heavily
  utilized by their bordering countries. In those lakes, ecosystem functioning is
  dominated by pelagic processes, where microorganisms are key components; however,
  protistan diversity is barely known. We investigated the community composition of
  small eukaryotes (&lt;10 µm) in surface waters of four African Lakes (Kivu, Edward,
  Albert and Victoria) by sequencing the 18S rRNA gene. Moreover, in the meromictic
  Lake Kivu, two stations were vertically studied. We found high protistan diversity
  distributed in 779 operational taxonomic units (OTUs), spanning in 11 high-rank
  lineages, being Alveolata (31%), Opisthokonta (20%) and Stramenopiles (17%) the
  most represented supergroups. Surface protistan assemblages were associated with
  conductivity and productivity gradients, whereas depth had a strong effect on protistan
  community in Kivu, with higher contribution of heterotrophic organisms. Approximately
  40% of OTUs had low similarity (&lt;90%) with reported sequences in public databases;
  these were mostly coming from deep anoxic waters of Kivu, suggesting a high extent
  of novel diversity. We also detected several taxa so far considered exclusive of
  marine ecosystems. Our results unveiled a complex and largely undescribed protistan
  community, in which several lineages have adapted to different niches after crossing
  the salinity boundary.
