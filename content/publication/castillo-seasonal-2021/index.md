abstract: Summary  Ostreococcus is a cosmopolitan marine genus of phytoplankton found
  in mesotrophic and oligotrophic waters, and the smallest free‐living eukaryotes
  known to date, with a cell diameter close to 1 μm. Ostreococcus has been extensively
  studied as a model system to investigate viral–host dynamics in culture, yet the
  impact of viruses in naturally occurring populations is largely unknown. Here, we
  used Virus Fluorescence in situ Hybridization (VirusFISH) to visualize and quantify
  viral‐host dynamics in natural populations of Ostreococcus during a seasonal cycle
  in the central Cantabrian Sea (Southern Bay of Biscay). Ostreococcus were predominantly
  found during summer and autumn at surface and 50 m depth, in coastal, mid‐shelf
  and shelf waters, representing up to 21% of the picoeukaryotic communities. Viral
  infection was only detected in surface waters, and its impact was variable but highest
  from May to July and November to December, when up to half of the population was
  infected. Metatranscriptomic data available from the mid‐shelf station unveiled
  that the Ostreococcus population was dominated by the species O. lucimarinus . This
  work represents a proof of concept that the VirusFISH technique can be used to quantify
  the impact of viruses on targeted populations of key microbes from complex natural
  communities.
