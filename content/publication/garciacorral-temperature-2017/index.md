abstract: 'Abstract  Here we assess the temperature dependence of the metabolic rates
  (gross primary production (GPP), community respiration (CR), and the ratio GPP/CR)
  of oceanic plankton communities. We compile data from 133 stations of the Malaspina
  2010 Expedition, distributed among the subtropical and tropical Atlantic, Pacific,
  and Indian oceans. We used the in vitro technique to measured metabolic rates during
  24 h incubations at three different sampled depths: surface, 20%, and 1% of the
  photosynthetically active radiation measured at surface. We also measured the %
  of ultraviolet B radiation (UVB) penetrating at surface waters. GPP and CR rates
  increased with warming, albeit different responses were observed for each sampled
  depth. The overall GPP/CR ratio declined with warming. Higher activation energies
  ( E  a  ) were derived for both processes (GPP Chla = 0.97; CR Chla = 1.26; CR HPA
  = 0.95 eV) compared to those previously reported. The Indian Ocean showed the highest
  E  a  (GPP Chla = 1.70; CR Chla = 1.48; CR HPA = 0.57 eV), while the Atlantic Ocean
  showed the lowest (GPP Chla = 0.86; CR Chla = 0.77; CR HPA = −0.13 eV). We believe
  that the difference between previous assessments and the ones presented here can
  be explained by the overrepresentation of Atlantic communities in the previous data
  sets. We found that UVB radiation also affects the temperature dependence of surface
  GPP, which decreased rather than increased under high levels of UVB. Ocean warming,
  which causes stratification and oligotrophication of the subtropical and tropical
  oceans, may lead to reduced surface GPP as a result of increased penetration of
  UVB radiation.  ,  Key Points    We assess the temperature dependence of oceanic
  plankton community metabolic rates   The ratio gross primary production/community
  respiration decreases with warming   Ultraviolet radiation influences the temperature
  dependence of surface productivity'
