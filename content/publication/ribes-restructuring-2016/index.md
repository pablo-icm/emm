abstract: Summary  Ocean acidification is increasing and affects many marine organisms.
  However, certain sponge species can withstand low‐pH conditions. This may be related
  to their complex association with microbes. We hypothesized that species with greater
  microbial diversity may develop functional redundancy that could enable the holobiont
  to survive even if particular microbes are lost at low‐pH conditions. We evaluated
  the effects of acidification on the growth and associated microbes of three ubiquitous
  Mediterranean sponges by exposing them to the present pH level and that predicted
  for the year 2100. We found marked differences among the species in the acquisition
  of new microbes, being high in Dysidea avara , moderate in Agelas oroides and null
  in Chondrosia reniformis ; however, we did not observe variation in the overall
  microbiome abundance, richness or diversity. The relative abilities to alter the
  microbiomes contributes to survivorship in an OA scenario as demonstrated by lowered
  pH severely affecting the growth of C. reniformis , halving that of A. oroides ,
  and unaffecting D. avara . Our results indicate that functional stability of the
  sponge holobiont to withstand future OA is species‐specific and is linked to the
  species’ ability to use horizontal transmission to modify the associated microbiome
  to adapt to environmental change.
