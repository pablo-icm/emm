abstract: Strong purifying selection is considered a major evolutionary force behind
  small microbial genomes in the resource-poor photic ocean. However, very little
  is currently known about how the size of prokaryotic genomes evolves in the global
  ocean and whether patterns reflect shifts in resource availability in the epipelagic
  and relatively stable deep-sea environmental conditions. Using 364 marine microbial
  metagenomes, we investigate how the average genome size of uncultured planktonic
  prokaryotes varies across the tropical and polar oceans to the hadal realm. We find
  that genome size is highest in the perennially cold polar ocean, reflecting elongation
  of coding genes and gene dosage effects due to duplications in the interior ocean
  microbiome. Moreover, the rate of change in genome size due to temperature is 16-fold
  higher than with depth up to 200 m. Our results demonstrate how environmental factors
  can influence marine microbial genome size selection and ecological strategies of
  the microbiome.
