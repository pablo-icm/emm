abstract: Abstract The Mediterranean Sea is a miniature ocean divided by the Sicily
  Strait into two basins with a marked west to east trophic gradient and separated
  of the nearby eastern Atlantic Ocean by the Strait of Gibraltar. Here, we test the
  hypothesis that these physical and environmental barriers favor the development
  of specific prokaryotic assemblages, leading to changes in community structure both
  in the vertical and horizontal spatial scales. By analyzing taxonomic and phylogenetic
  diversity using amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) of the 16S rRNA gene, we show
  that there is indeed marked vertical segregation of prokaryotic groups, similar
  to that found in other areas of the ocean, but also a clear horizontal structuring
  among the two Mediterranean basins and the adjacent Atlantic waters. Prokaryotic
  diversity increased with depth and toward the Atlantic, whereas the easternmost
  stations displayed more phylogenetically diverse phylotypes, despite harboring globally
  less diverse communities. Basin‐indicator taxa (ASVs) accounted for a large fraction
  of the community (between 50% and 80%) in each of the basins at the surface and
  bathypelagic layers, being associated with different environmental variables. The
  existence of biogeographic and environmental barriers in the Mediterranean Sea is
  likely related to the trophic gradient at the surface and the isolation of water
  bodies in depth due to the Gibraltar and Sicily straits. Our work highlights the
  importance of studying microbial regional biogeography and provides the basis for
  future studies on the impact of this regionalization in the function of Mediterranean
  Sea prokaryotic communities.
