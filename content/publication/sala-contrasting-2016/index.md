abstract: 'Abstract We investigated the effects of an increase in dissolved CO2 on
  the microbial communities of the Mediterranean Sea during two mesocosm experiments
  in two contrasting seasons: winter, at the peak of the annual phytoplankton bloom,
  and summer, under low nutrient conditions. The experiments included treatments with
  acidification and nutrient addition, and combinations of the two. We followed the
  effects of ocean acidification (OA) on the abundance of the main groups of microorganisms
  (diatoms, dinoflagellates, nanoeukaryotes, picoeukaryotes, cyanobacteria, and heterotrophic
  bacteria) and on bacterial activity, leucine incorporation, and extracellular enzyme
  activity. Our results showed a clear stimulation effect of OA on the abundance of
  small phytoplankton (pico- and nanoeukaryotes), independently of the season and
  nutrient availability. A large number of the measured variables showed significant
  positive effects of acidification in summer compared with winter, when the effects
  were sometimes negative. Effects of OA were more conspicuous when nutrient concentrations
  were low. Our results therefore suggest that microbial communities in oligotrophic
  waters are considerably affected by OA, whereas microbes in more productive waters
  are less affected. The overall enhancing effect of acidification on eukaryotic pico-
  and nanophytoplankton, in comparison with the non-significant or even negative response
  to nutrient-rich conditions of larger groups and autotrophic prokaryotes, suggests
  a shift towards medium-sized producers in a future acidified ocean.'
