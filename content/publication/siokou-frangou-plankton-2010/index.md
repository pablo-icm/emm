abstract: Abstract. We present an overview of the plankton studies conducted during
  the last 25 years in the epipelagic offshore waters of the Mediterranean Sea. This
  quasi-enclosed sea is characterized by a rich and complex physical dynamics with
  distinctive traits, especially in regard to the thermohaline circulation. Recent
  investigations have basically confirmed the long-recognised oligotrophic nature
  of this sea, which increases along both the west-east and the north-south directions.
  Nutrient availability is low, especially for phosphorous (N:P up to 60), though
  this limitation may be buffered by inputs from highly populated coasts and from
  the atmosphere. Phytoplankton biomass, as chl a, generally displays low values (less
  than 0.2 μg chl a l−1) over large areas, with a modest late winter increase. A large
  bloom (up to 3 μg l−1) is observed throughout the late winter and spring exclusively
  in the NW area. Relatively high biomass values are recorded in fronts and cyclonic
  gyres. A deep chlorophyll maximum is a permanent feature for the whole basin, except
  during the late winter mixing. It is found at increasingly greater depths ranging
  from 30 m in the Alboran Sea to 120 m in the easternmost Levantine basin. Primary
  production reveals a west-east decreasing trend and ranges between 59 and 150 g
  C m−2 y−1 (in situ measurements). Overall, the basin is largely dominated by small
  autotrophs, microheterotrophs and egg-carrying copepod species. The microorganisms
  (phytoplankton, viruses, bacteria, flagellates and ciliates) and zooplankton components
  reveal a considerable diversity and variability over spatial and temporal scales,
  although the latter is poorly studied. Examples are the wide diversity of dinoflagellates
  and coccolithophores, the multifarious role of diatoms or picoeukaryotes, and the
  distinct seasonal or spatial patterns of the species-rich copepod genera or families
  which dominate the basin. Major dissimilarities between western and eastern basins
  have been highlighted in species composition of phytoplankton and mesozooplankton,
  but also in the heterotrophic microbial components and in their relationships. Superimposed
  to these longitudinal differences, a pronounced biological heterogeneity is also
  observed in areas hosting deep convection, fronts, cyclonic and anti-cyclonic gyres
  or eddies. In such areas, the intermittent nutrient enrichment promotes a switching
  between a small-sized microbial community and diatom-dominated populations. A classical
  food web readily substitutes the microbial food web in these cases. These switches,
  likely occurring within a continuum of trophic pathways, may greatly increase the
  flux towards higher trophic levels, in spite of the apparent heterotrophy. Basically,
  the microbial system seems to be both bottom-up and top-down controlled. A \"multivorous
  web\" is shown by the great variety of feeding modes and preferences and by the
  significant and simultaneous grazing impact on phytoplankton and ciliates by mesozooplankton.
