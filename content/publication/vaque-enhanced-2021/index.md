abstract: The ocean surface microlayer (SML), with physicochemical characteristics
  different from those of subsurface waters (SSW), results in dense and active viral
  and microbial communities that may favor virus–host interactions. Conversely, wind
  speed and/or UV radiation could adversely affect virus infection. Furthermore, in
  polar regions, organic and inorganic nutrient inputs from melting ice may increase
  microbial activity in the SML. Since the role of viruses in the microbial food web
  of the SML is poorly understood in polar oceans, we aimed to study the impact of
  viruses on prokaryotic communities in the SML and in the SSW in Arctic and Antarctic
  waters. We hypothesized that a higher viral activity in the SML than in the SSW
  in both polar systems would be observed. We measured viral and prokaryote abundances,
  virus-mediated mortality on prokaryotes, heterotrophic and phototrophic nanoflagellate
  abundance, and environmental factors. In both polar zones, we found small differences
  in environmental factors between the SML and the SSW. In contrast, despite the adverse
  effect of wind, viral and prokaryote abundances and virus-mediated mortality on
  prokaryotes were higher in the SML than in the SSW. As a consequence, the higher
  carbon flux released by lysed cells in the SML than in the SSW would increase the
  pool of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and be rapidly used by other prokaryotes
  to grow (the viral shunt). Thus, our results suggest that viral activity greatly
  contributes to the functioning of the microbial food web in the SML, which could
  influence the biogeochemical cycles of the water column.
