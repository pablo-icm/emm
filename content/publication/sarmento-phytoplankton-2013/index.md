abstract: Despite representing only a small fraction of the ocean's dissolved organic
  matter pool, dissolved free amino acids (DFAA) have high turnover rates and are
  major nitrogen and carbon sources for bacterioplankton. Both phytoplankton and bacterioplankton
  assimilate and release DFAA, but their consumption and production are difficult
  to quantify in nature due to their short residence times (min) as dissolved monomers.
  We segregated DFAA production by phytoplankton and bacterial consumption by measuring
  individual DFAA concentrations in four axenic phytoplankton cultures during the
  exponential growth phase, and also after 4 d incubations in the presence of a natural
  bacterioplankton community. The amounts and composition of the DFAA pool varied
  widely among phytoplankton species. The proportion of dissolved organic carbon attributed
  to DFAA varied among cultures. The picoeukaryotic prasinophyte, Micromonas pusilla,
  released higher amounts of DFAA than the other species tested (diatoms and dinoflagellate),
  especially alanine, which has been reported as the dominant individual DFAA in some
  oligotrophic environments. Community structure of heterotrophic prokaryotes responded
  to differences in the quality of organic matter released among microalgal species,
  with Roseobacter ‐related bacteria responding strongly to exudate composition. Our
  results demonstrate the specificity of DFAA extracellular release among several
  algal species and their preferential uptake by members of bacterial communities.
