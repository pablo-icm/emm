abstract: We studied the dynamics of two populations of anaerobic ciliates, Plagiopyla
  sp. and Metopus sp., and of their potential prey, heterotrophic and phototrophic
  purple bacteria, in Lake Cis贸 throughout a 1-year cycle. The abundance of both ciliates
  was very low (less than 2 individuals per ml). During mixing, Plagiopyla ciliates
  exhibited high clearance rates (about 100 nl ciliate -1 h -1 ), its integrated abundance
  increased with a net doubling time of 47 days, and its potential doubling times,
  as calculated from the number of bacteria consumed, ranged between 5 and 8 days.
  During stratification, the activity of Plagiopyla ciliates was reduced and the population
  decreased; this was related to the higher amounts of sulfide present. The impact
  of predation by the Plagiopyla population on bacterioplankton was found to be insignificant,
  less than 0.1% of bacterial biomass consumed per day. Thus, anaerobic ciliates cannot
  control the bacterioplankton in Lake Cis贸 because of both the low abundance over
  the period studied and the low feeding rates during certain periods. A review of
  available field studies suggests that this conclusion can be extrapolated to most
  other anoxic systems.
