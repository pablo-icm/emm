abstract: 'Abstract Depending on their relationship with the pelagic particulate matter,
  planktonic prokaryotes have traditionally been classified into two types of communities:
  free-living (FL) or attached (ATT) to particles, and are generally separated using
  only one pore-size filter in a differential filtration. Nonetheless, particulate
  matter in the oceans appears in a continuum of sizes. Here we separated this continuum
  into six discrete size-fractions, from 0.2 to 200 μm, and described the prokaryotes
  associated to each of them. Each size-fraction presented different bacterial communities,
  with a range of 23–42% of unique (OTUs) in each size-fraction, supporting the idea
  that they contained distinct types of particles. An increase in richness was observed
  from the smallest to the largest size-fractions, suggesting that increasingly larger
  particles contributed new niches. Our results show that a multiple size-fractionation
  provides a more exhaustive description of the bacterial diversity and community
  structure than the use of only one filter. In addition, and based on our results,
  we propose an alternative to the dichotomy of FL or ATT lifestyles, in which we
  differentiate the taxonomic groups with preference for the smaller fractions, those
  that do not show preferences for small or large fractions, and those that preferentially
  appear in larger fractions.'
