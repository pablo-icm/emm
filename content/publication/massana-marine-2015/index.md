abstract: 'Summary  Although protists are critical components of marine ecosystems,
  they are still poorly characterized. Here we analysed the taxonomic diversity of
  planktonic and benthic protist communities collected in six distant E uropean coastal
  sites. Environmental deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) and ribonucleic acid ( RNA )
  from three size fractions (pico‐, nano‐ and micro/mesoplankton), as well as from
  dissolved DNA and surface sediments were used as templates for tag pyrosequencing
  of the V4 region of the 18S ribosomal DNA. Beta‐diversity analyses split the protist
  community structure into three main clusters: picoplankton‐nanoplankton‐dissolved
  DNA , micro/mesoplankton and sediments. Within each cluster, protist communities
  from the same site and time clustered together, while communities from the same
  site but different seasons were unrelated. Both DNA and RNA ‐based surveys provided
  similar relative abundances for most class‐level taxonomic groups. Yet, particular
  groups were overrepresented in one of the two templates, such as marine alveolates
  ( MALV )‐ I and MALV‐II that were much more abundant in DNA surveys. Overall, the
  groups displaying the highest relative contribution were Dinophyceae, Diatomea,
  Ciliophora and Acantharia. Also, well represented were Mamiellophyceae, Cryptomonadales,
  marine alveolates and marine stramenopiles in the picoplankton, and Monadofilosa
  and basal F ungi in sediments. Our extensive and systematic sequencing of geographically
  separated sites provides the most comprehensive molecular description of coastal
  marine protist diversity to date.'
