abstract: "Summary

Microbial successions were studied in experimental mesocosms of marine water in the presence of additional organic carbon (glucose), phosphorus (P) or both. P addition lead to pronounced blooms of phytoplankton and to significantly enhanced bacterial production. Characteristic succession patterns were observed for two phylogenetic groups of bacteria that both transiently formed \textgreater 50% of total cells. An initial bloom of bacteria affiliated to the
Alteromonadaceae
could not be assigned to any specific treatment and was interpreted as a response to the manipulations during mesocosm set‐up. These bacteria rapidly declined with the appearance of heterotrophic nanoflagellates, suggesting a negative effect of selective grazing. The persistence of
Alteromonadaceae
in the microbial assemblages was significantly favored by the presence of additional glucose. During the second half of the experiment, bacteria affiliated to
Rhodobacteriaceae
formed a dominant component of the experimental assemblages in treatments with addition of P. The community contribution of
Rhodobacteriaceae
was significantly correlated with chlorophyll
a
concentrations only in the P‐amended mesocosms (
r
2
= 0.58). This was more pronounced in the absence of glucose (
r
2
= 0.85). The phylogenetic and morphological diversity among
Rhodobacteriaceae
was high, and treatment‐specific temporal successions of genotypes related to
Rhodobacteriaceae
were observed. We suggest that the observed succession patterns reflect different niche preferences:
Alteromonadaceae
rapidly responded to disturbance and profited from allochthonous glucose input, whereas
Rhodobacteriaceae
benefited from the phytoplankton bloom."
