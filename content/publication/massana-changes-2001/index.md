abstract: Bottle incubations, during which the activity and growth of prokaryotes
  is monitored during several days, are frequently carried out to study functional
  aspects of marine prokaryotic assemblages. These experiments will relate directly
  to in situ activities if all populations grow harmonically during the incubation.
  We tested whether this was the case by analyzing the composition of bacterial assemblages
  at the beginning and at the end of the incubation by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis.
  Five experiments were done in different Antarctic regions. Bacterial assemblages
  north and south of the Polar Front were very different. In all cases, the final
  assemblages were very different from the initial ones, and these changes were often
  accompanied by a significant decrease of diversity indices. Our experiments included
  treatments with different temperature and organic matter amendments. Whereas the
  increase in temperature tested had a minor effect on prokaryotic growth rate and
  specific composition, the addition of organic matter strongly stimulated growth
  rate and selected a particular bacterial assemblage in some experiments but not
  in others. A significant component of bacterial assemblages from waters south of
  the Polar Front appeared to be Polaribacter franzmannii , a gas vacuolated bacterium
  of the CytophagaߚFlavobacteriumߚBacteroides group that was originally isolated from
  Antarctic sea ice. This phylotype was enriched and dominated in almost all final
  assemblages. Our results indicate that longߚterm bottle incubations mostly measure
  the activity of a few opportunistic bacteria and not that of the original assemblage.
  This should be taken into account if data obtained in these experiments are used
  for balancing whole ecosystem carbon budgets and to derive biogeochemical conclusions.
