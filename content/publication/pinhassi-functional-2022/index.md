abstract: Coastal ecosystems deteriorate globally due to human-induced stress factors,
  like nutrient loading and pollution. Bacteria are critical to marine ecosystems,
  e.g., by regulating nutrient cycles, synthesizing vitamins, or degrading pollutants,
  thereby providing essential ecosystem services ultimately affecting economic activities.
  Yet, until now bacteria are overlooked both as mediators and indicators of ecosystem
  health, mainly due to methodological limitations in assessing bacterial ecosystem
  functions. However, these limitations are largely overcome by the advances in molecular
  biology and bioinformatics methods for characterizing the genetics that underlie
  functional traits of key bacterial populations – “key” in providing important ecosystem
  services, being abundant, or by possessing high metabolic rates. It is therefore
  timely to analyze and define the functional responses of bacteria to human-induced
  effects on coastal ecosystem health. We posit that categorizing the responses of
  key marine bacterial populations to changes in environmental conditions through
  modern microbial oceanography methods will allow establishing the nascent field
  of genetic counselling for our coastal waters. This requires systematic field studies
  of linkages between functional traits of key bacterial populations and their ecosystem
  functions in coastal seas, complemented with systematic experimental analyses of
  the responses to different stressors. Research and training in environmental management
  along with dissemination of results and dialogue with societal actors are equally
  important to ensure the role of bacteria is understood as fundamentally important
  for coastal ecosystems. Using the responses of microorganisms as a tool to develop
  genetic counselling for coastal ecosystems can ultimately allow for integrating
  bacteria as indicators of environmental change.
