abstract: Trophic interactions between marine phytoplankton and heterotrophic bacteria
  are at the base of the biogeochemical carbon cycling in the ocean. However, the
  specific interactions taking place between phytoplankton and bacterial taxa remain
  largely unexplored, particularly out of phytoplankton blooming events. Here, we
  applied network analysis to a 3.5-year time-series dataset to assess the specific
  associations between different phytoplankton and bacterial taxa along the seasonal
  scale, distinguishing between free-living and particle-attached bacteria. Using
  a newly developed network post-analysis technique we removed bacteria-phytoplankton
  correlations that were primarily driven by environmental parameters, to detect potential
  biotic interactions. Our results indicate that phytoplankton dynamics may be a strong
  driver of the inter-annual variability in bacterial community composition. We found
  the highest abundance of specific bacteria-phytoplankton associations in the particle-attached
  fraction, indicating a tighter bacteria-phytoplankton association than in the free-living
  fraction. In the particle-associated fraction we unveiled novel potential associations
  such as the one between Planctomycetes taxa and the diatom Leptocylindrus spp. Consistent
  correlations were also found between free-living bacterial taxa and different diatoms,
  including novel associations such as those between SAR11 with Naviculales diatom
  order, and between Actinobacteria and Cylindrotheca spp. We also confirmed previously
  known associations between Rhodobacteraceae and Thalassiosira spp. Our results expand
  our view on bacteria-phytoplankton associations, suggesting that taxa-specific interactions
  may largely impact the seasonal dynamics of heterotrophic bacterial communities.
