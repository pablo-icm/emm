abstract: ABSTRACT  The effect of irradiance in the range of 400 to 700 nm or photosynthetically
  active radiation (PAR) on bacterial heterotrophic production estimated by the incorporation
  of 3 H-leucine (referred to herein as Leu) was investigated in the northwestern
  Mediterranean Sea and in a coastal North Atlantic site, with Leu uptake rates ranging
  over 3 orders of magnitude. We performed in situ incubations under natural irradiance
  levels of Mediterranean samples taken from five depths around solar noon and compared
  them to incubations in the dark. In two of the three stations large differences
  were found between light and dark uptake rates for the surfacemost samples, with
  dark values being on average 133 and 109% higher than in situ ones. Data obtained
  in coastal North Atlantic waters confirmed that dark enclosure may increase Leu
  uptake rates more than threefold. To explain these differences, on-board experiments
  of Leu uptake versus irradiance were performed with Mediterranean samples from depths
  of 5 and 40 m. Incubations under a gradient of 12 to 1,731 μmol of photons m −2
  s −1 evidenced a significant increase in incorporation rates with increasing PAR
  in most of the experiments, with dark-incubated samples departing from this pattern.
  These results were not attributed to inhibition of Leu uptake in the light but to
  enhanced bacterial response when transferred to dark conditions. The ratio of dark
  to light uptake rates increased as dissolved inorganic nitrogen concentrations decreased,
  suggesting that bacterial nutrient deficiency was overcome by some process occurring
  only in the dark bottles.
