abstract: Summary  The symbiotic unicellular cyanobacterium Candidatus Atelocyanobacterium
  thalassa (UCYN‐A) is one of the most abundant and widespread nitrogen (N 2 )‐fixing
  cyanobacteria in the ocean. Although it remains uncultivated, multiple sublineages
  have been detected based on partial nitrogenase ( nifH ) gene sequences, including
  the four most commonly detected sublineages UCYN‐A1, UCYN‐A2, UCYN‐A3 and UCYN‐A4.
  However, very little is known about UCYN‐A3 beyond the nifH sequences from nifH
  gene diversity surveys. In this study, single cell sorting, DNA sequencing, qPCR
  and CARD‐FISH assays revealed discrepancies involving the identification of sublineages,
  which led to new information on the diversity of the UCYN‐A symbiosis. 16S rRNA
  and nifH gene sequencing on single sorted cells allowed us to identify the 16S rRNA
  gene of the uncharacterized UCYN‐A3 sublineage. We designed new CARD‐FISH probes
  that allowed us to distinguish and observe UCYN‐A2 in a coastal location (SIO Pier;
  San Diego) and UCYN‐A3 in an open ocean location (Station ALOHA; Hawaii). Moreover,
  we reconstructed about 13% of the UCYN‐A3 genome from Tara Oceans metagenomic data.
  Finally, our findings unveil the UCYN‐A3 symbiosis in open ocean waters suggesting
  that the different UCYN‐A sublineages are distributed along different size fractions
  of the plankton defined by the cell‐size ranges of their prymnesiophyte hosts.
