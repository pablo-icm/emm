abstract: Abstract Aerobic anoxygenic phototrophic (AAP) bacteria are microorganisms
  that can harvest light energy using bacteriochlorophyll a to supplement their predominantly
  organotrophic metabolism. Growth enhancement by light has repeatedly been demonstrated
  in laboratory experiments with AAP isolates. However, the ecological advantage of
  light utilization is unclear, as it has never been proven in the natural environment.
  Here, we conducted manipulation experiments in the NW Mediterranean and found that
  AAP bacteria display high growth rates which are controlled to a large extent by
  intense grazing pressure and phosphorous availability. Foremost, we found that,
  contrarily to the bulk bacterioplakton, AAP bacteria display higher growth rates
  when incubated under light-dark cycles than in complete darkness. These results
  represent the first direct evidence that natural populations of marine AAP bacteria
  can be stimulated by light.
