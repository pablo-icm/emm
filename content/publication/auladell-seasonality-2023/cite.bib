Microbes drive the biogeochemical cycles of marine ecosystems through their vast metabolic diversity. While we have a fairly good understanding of the spatial distribution of these metabolic processes in various ecosystems, less is known about their seasonal dynamics. We investigated the annual patterns of 21 biogeochemical relevant functions in an oligotrophic coastal ocean site by analysing the presence of key genes, analysing high‐rank gene taxonomy and the dynamics of nucleotide variants. Most genes presented seasonality: photoheterotrophic processes were enriched during spring, phosphorous‐related genes were dominant during summer, coinciding with potential phosphate limitation, and assimilatory nitrate reductases appeared mostly during summer and autumn, correlating negatively with nitrate availability. Additionally, we identified the main taxa driving each function at each season and described the role of underrecognized taxa such as
Litoricolaceae
in carbon fixation (
rbcL
), urea degradation (
ureC
), and CO oxidation (
coxL
). Finally, the seasonality of single variants of some families presented a decoupling between the taxonomic abundance patterns and the functional gene patterns, implying functional specialization of the different genera. Our study unveils the seasonality of key biogeochemical functions and the main taxonomic groups that harbour these relevant functions in a coastal ocean ecosystem.},
