abstract: 'Abstract  Microbes drive the biogeochemical cycles of marine ecosystems
  through their vast metabolic diversity. While we have a fairly good understanding
  of the spatial distribution of these metabolic processes in various ecosystems,
  less is known about their seasonal dynamics. We investigated the annual patterns
  of 21 biogeochemical relevant functions in an oligotrophic coastal ocean site by
  analysing the presence of key genes, analysing high-rank gene taxonomy and the dynamics
  of nucleotide variants. Most genes presented seasonality: photoheterotrophic processes
  were enriched during spring, phosphorous-related genes were dominant during summer,
  coinciding with potential phosphate limitation, and assimilatory nitrate reductases
  appeared mostly during summer and autumn, correlating negatively with nitrate availability.
  Additionally, we identified the main taxa driving each function at each season and
  described the role of underrecognized taxa such as Litoricolaceae in carbon fixation
  ( rbcL ), urea degradation ( ureC ), and CO oxidation ( coxL ). Finally, the seasonality
  of single variants of some families presented a decoupling between the taxonomic
  abundance patterns and the functional gene patterns, implying functional specialization
  of the different genera. Our study unveils the seasonality of key biogeochemical
  functions and the main taxonomic groups that harbour these relevant functions in
  a coastal ocean ecosystem.'
