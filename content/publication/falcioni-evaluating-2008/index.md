abstract: 'ABSTRACT  Since heterotrophic prokaryotes play an important biogeochemical
  role in aquatic ecosystems and have a high capacity to survive in extreme environments,
  easy-to-perform protocols that probe their physiological states and the effects
  of environmental variables on those states are highly desired. Some methodologies
  combine a general nucleic acid stain with a membrane integrity probe. We calibrated
  one of these, the nucleic acid double-staining (NADS) protocol (G. Grégori, S. Citterio,
  A. Ghiani, M. Labra, S. Sgorbati, S. Brown, and M. Denis, Appl. Environ. Microbiol.
  67:4662-4670, 2001), determining the optimal stain concentrations in seawater and
  the response to conditions that generate prokaryote death (such as heat) and to
  conditions that are known to produce death in plankton, such as nutrient limitation
  or flagellate grazing. The protocol was validated by comparison to two methods used
  to detect viability: active respiration by 5-cyano-2,3-ditolyl tetrazolium chloride
  (CTC) and incorporation of tritiated leucine. We show that concentrations in the
  range of 5 to 20 μg ml −1 of propidium iodide, simultaneous to a 10× concentration
  of Sybr green I, are best for detecting two separated populations of “live” (green
  cells) and “dead” (red cells) organisms. During exposure to heat and UVC, we observed
  that the number of live cells declined concurrently with that of actively respiring
  cells (CTC positive) and with total leucine incorporation. In seawater mesocosms,
  the NADS protocol allowed detection of bacterioplankton starvation-related death
  and flagellate predation. The protocol was also tested in deep profiles in the northwest
  Atlantic, demonstrating its potential for routine characterization of this fraction
  of the physiological diversity of marine heterotrophic prokaryotic plankton.'
