Since heterotrophic prokaryotes play an important biogeochemical role in aquatic ecosystems and have a high capacity to survive in extreme environments, easy-to-perform protocols that probe their physiological states and the effects of environmental variables on those states are highly desired. Some methodologies combine a general nucleic acid stain with a membrane integrity probe. We calibrated one of these, the nucleic acid double-staining (NADS) protocol (G. Grégori, S. Citterio, A. Ghiani, M. Labra, S. Sgorbati, S. Brown, and M. Denis, Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 67:4662-4670, 2001), determining the optimal stain concentrations in seawater and the response to conditions that generate prokaryote death (such as heat) and to conditions that are known to produce death in plankton, such as nutrient limitation or flagellate grazing. The protocol was validated by comparison to two methods used to detect viability: active respiration by 5-cyano-2,3-ditolyl tetrazolium chloride (CTC) and incorporation of tritiated leucine. We show that concentrations in the range of 5 to 20 μg ml
−1
of propidium iodide, simultaneous to a 10× concentration of Sybr green I, are best for detecting two separated populations of “live” (green cells) and “dead” (red cells) organisms. During exposure to heat and UVC, we observed that the number of live cells declined concurrently with that of actively respiring cells (CTC positive) and with total leucine incorporation. In seawater mesocosms, the NADS protocol allowed detection of bacterioplankton starvation-related death and flagellate predation. The protocol was also tested in deep profiles in the northwest Atlantic, demonstrating its potential for routine characterization of this fraction of the physiological diversity of marine heterotrophic prokaryotic plankton.},
