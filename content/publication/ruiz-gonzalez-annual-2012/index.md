abstract: 'The effect of photosynthetically available radiation (PAR; 400–700 nm)
  and ultraviolet radiation (UVR; 280–400 nm) on marine bacterial heterotrophic activity
  was assessed monthly throughout a seasonal cycle in Blanes Bay (northwestern Mediterranean
  Sea). Seawater samples amended with 3 H‐leucine were exposed to solar radiation
  under three radiation treatments: PAR + UVR (280–700 nm), PAR + UVA (320–700 nm),
  and PAR only. Parallel reference incubations in the dark and under a fixed artificial
  light source (PAR only) were also performed. Exposure to high UVR doses caused strong
  inhibition of 3 H‐leucine incorporation rates (LIR), whereas natural PAR doses did
  not cause overall significant effects. Within UVR, UVA radiation accounted for most
  of the reduction in LIR, and this effect was modulated by the proportionality of
  the experimental light to the previous light exposure history of the samples. Constant
  (artificial) PAR‐only exposure led to a general but seasonally variable increase
  in bacterial heterotrophic production compared to the dark controls, with large
  increases in spring and lower changes during summer. This pattern was likely caused
  by the stimulation of the bacterial group Gammaproteobacteria , which showed higher
  numbers of cells active in 3 H‐leucine uptake after light exposure. Again, the previous
  light history of the samples seemed to partly explain the measured effects. Overall,
  our results show variable responses of bacterial activities to light manipulations,
  depending on seasonally changing light conditions and communities, and stress the
  importance of realistic simulation of light exposure conditions for ecosystem‐relevant
  photobiological studies with microbial plankton.'
