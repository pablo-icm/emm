abstract: Abstract Microbial taxa range from being ubiquitous and abundant across
  space to extremely rare and endemic, depending on their ecophysiology and on different
  processes acting locally or regionally. However, little is known about how cosmopolitan
  or rare taxa combine to constitute communities and whether environmental variations
  promote changes in their relative abundances. Here we identified the Spatial Abundance
  Distribution (SpAD) of individual prokaryotic taxa (16S rDNA-defined Operational
  Taxonomic Units, OTUs) across 108 globally-distributed surface ocean stations. We
  grouped taxa based on their SpAD shape (“normal-like”- abundant and ubiquitous;
  “logistic”- globally rare, present in few sites; and “bimodal”- abundant only in
  certain oceanic regions), and investigated how the abundance of these three categories
  relates to environmental gradients. Most surface assemblages were numerically dominated
  by a few cosmopolitan “normal-like” OTUs, yet there was a gradual shift towards
  assemblages dominated by “logistic” taxa in specific areas with productivity and
  temperature differing the most from the average conditions in the sampled stations.
  When we performed the SpAD categorization including additional habitats (deeper
  layers and particles of varying sizes), the SpAD of many OTUs changed towards fewer
  “normal-like” shapes, and OTUs categorized as globally rare in the surface ocean
  became abundant. This suggests that understanding the mechanisms behind microbial
  rarity and dominance requires expanding the context of study beyond local communities
  and single habitats. We show that marine bacterial communities comprise taxa displaying
  a continuum of SpADs, and that variations in their abundances can be linked to habitat
  transitions or barriers that delimit the distribution of community members.
