abstract: Abstract  Aim Dispersal and environmental gradients shape marine microbial
  communities, yet the relative importance of these factors across taxa with distinct
  sizes and dispersal capacity in different ocean layers is unknown. Here, we report
  a comparative analysis of surface and deep ocean microbial beta diversity and examine
  how these patterns are tied to oceanic distance and environmental gradients.   Location
  Tropical and subtropical oceans (30°N–40°S).   Time period 2010–2011.   Major taxa
  studied Prokaryotes and picoeukaryotes (eukaryotes between 0.2 and 3 μm).   Methods
  Beta diversity was calculated from metabarcoding data on prokaryotic and picoeukaryotic
  microbes collected during the Malaspina expedition across the tropical and subtropical
  oceans. Mantel correlations were used to determine the relative contribution of
  environment and oceanic distance driving community beta diversity.   Results Mean
  community similarity across all sites for prokaryotes was 38.9% in the surface and
  51.4% in the deep ocean, compared to mean similarity of 25.8 and 12.1% in the surface
  and deep ocean, respectively, for picoeukaryotes. Higher dispersal rates and smaller
  body sizes of prokaryotes relative to picoeukaryotes likely contributed to the significantly
  higher community similarity for prokaryotes compared with picoeukaryotes. The ecological
  mechanisms determining the biogeography of microbes varied across depth. In the
  surface ocean, the environmental differences in space were a more important factor
  driving microbial distribution compared with the oceanic distance, defined as the
  shortest path between two sites avoiding land. In the deep ocean, picoeukaryote
  communities were slightly more structured by the oceanic distance, while prokaryotes
  were shaped by the combined action of oceanic distance and environmental filtering.   Main
  conclusions Horizontal gradients in microbial community assembly differed across
  ocean depths, as did mechanisms shaping them. In the deep ocean, the oceanic distance
  and environment played significant roles driving microbial spatial distribution,
  while in the surface the influence of the environment was stronger than oceanic
  distance.
