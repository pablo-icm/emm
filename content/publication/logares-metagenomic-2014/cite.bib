Sequencing of
16S rDNA
polymerase chain reaction (
PCR
) amplicons is the most common approach for investigating environmental prokaryotic diversity, despite the known biases introduced during
PCR
. Here we show that
16S rDNA
fragments derived from Illumina‐sequenced environmental metagenomes (

s) are a powerful alternative to
16S rDNA
amplicons for investigating the taxonomic diversity and structure of prokaryotic communities. As part of the

ceans global expedition, marine plankton was sampled in three locations, resulting in 29 subsamples for which metagenomes were produced by shotgun Illumina sequencing (ca. 700 Gb). For comparative analyses, a subset of samples was also selected for
R
oche‐454 sequencing using both shotgun (

s; 13 metagenomes, ca. 2.4 Gb) and 16S rDNA amplicon (

s; ca. 0.075 Gb) approaches. Our results indicate that by overcoming
PCR
biases related to amplification and primer mismatch,

s may provide more realistic estimates of community richness and evenness than amplicon

s. In addition,

s can capture expected beta diversity patterns. Using

s is now economically feasible given the dramatic reduction in high‐throughput sequencing costs, having the advantage of retrieving simultaneously both taxonomic (
