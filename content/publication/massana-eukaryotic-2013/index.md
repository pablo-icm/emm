abstract: Summary Marine microorganisms contribute markedly to global biomass and
  ecosystem function. They include a diverse collection of organisms differing in
  cell size and in evolutionary history. In particular, microbes within the picoplankton
  are similar in size but belong to two drastically different cellular plans, the
  prokaryotes and the eukaryotes. Compared with larger organisms, prokaryotes and
  picoeukaryotes share ecological features, such as high specific activity, large
  and constant abundances, and high dispersal potential. Still, there are some aspects
  where their different cell organization influences their ecological performance.
  First, prokaryotes have a huge metabolic versatility and are involved in all biogeochemical
  cycles, whereas picoeukaryotes are metabolically less flexible but can exploit diverse
  predatory life strategies due to their phagocytic capacity. Second, sexual reproduction
  is absent in prokaryotes but may be present in picoeukaryotes, thus determining
  different evolutionary diversification dynamics and making species limits clearer
  in picoeukaryotes. Finally, it is plausible that picoeukaryotes are less flexible
  to enter a reversible state of low metabolic activity, thus picoeukaryote assemblages
  may have fewer rare species and may be less resilient to environmental change. In
  summary, lumping together pico-sized microbes may be convenient for some ecological
  studies, but it is also important to keep in mind their differences.
