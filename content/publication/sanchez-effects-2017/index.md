abstract: Summary  Estimation of growth rates is crucial to understand the ecological
  role of prokaryotes and their contribution to marine biogeochemical cycling. However,
  there are only a few estimates for individual taxa. Two top‐down (grazing) and bottom‐up
  (phosphorus (P) availability) manipulation experiments were conducted under different
  light regimes in the NW Mediterranean Sea. Growth rate of different phylogenetic
  groups, including the Bacteroidetes, Rhodobacteraceae , SAR11, Gammaproteobacteria
  and its subgroups Alteromonadaceae and the NOR5/OM60 clade, were estimated from
  changes in cell numbers. Maximal growth rates were achieved in the P‐amended treatments
  but when comparing values between treatments (response ratios), the response to
  predation removal was in general larger than to P‐amendment. The Alteromonadaceae
  displayed the highest rates in both experiments followed by the Rhodobacteraceae
  , but all groups largely responded to filtration and P‐amendment, even the SAR11
  which presented low growth rates. Comparing light and dark treatments, growth rates
  were on average equal or higher in the dark than in the light for all groups, except
  for the Rhodobacteraceae and particularly the NOR5 clade, groups that contain photoheterotrophic
  species. These results are useful to evaluate the potential contributions of different
  bacterial types to biogeochemical processes under changing environmental conditions.
