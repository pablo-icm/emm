abstract: Anthropogenic carbon emissions are causing changes in seawater carbonate
  chemistry including a decline in the pH of the oceans. While its aftermath for calcifying
  microbes has been widely studied, the effect of ocean acidification (OA) on marine
  viruses and their microbial hosts is controversial, and even more in combination
  with another anthropogenic stressor, i.e., human-induced nutrient loads. In this
  study, two mesocosm acidification experiments with Mediterranean waters from different
  seasons revealed distinct effects of OA on viruses and viral-mediated prokaryotic
  mortality depending on the trophic state and the successional stage of the plankton
  community. In the winter bloom situation, low fluorescence viruses, the most abundant
  virus-like particle (VLP) subpopulation comprising mostly bacteriophages, were negatively
  affected by lowered pH with nutrient addition, while the bacterial host abundance
  was stimulated. High fluorescence viruses, containing cyanophages, were stimulated
  by OA regardless of the nutrient conditions, while cyanobacteria of the genus Synechococcus
  were negatively affected by OA. Moreover, the abundance of very high fluorescence
  viruses infecting small haptophytes tended to be lower under acidification while
  their putative hosts' abundance was enhanced, suggesting a direct and negative effect
  of OA on viral–host interactions. In the oligotrophic summer situation, we found
  a stimulating effect of OA on total viral abundance and the viral populations, suggesting
  a cascading effect of the elevated p CO 2 stimulating autotrophic and heterotrophic
  production. In winter, viral lysis accounted for 30 ± 16% of the loss of bacterial
  standing stock per day (VMM BSS ) under increased p CO 2 compared to 53 ± 35% in
  the control treatments, without effects of nutrient additions while in summer, OA
  had no significant effects on VMM BSS (35 ± 20% and 38 ± 5% per day in the OA and
  control treatments, respectively). We found that phage production and resulting
  organic carbon release rates significantly reduced under OA in the nutrient replete
  winter situation, but it was also observed that high nutrient loads lowered the
  negative effect of OA on viral lysis, suggesting an antagonistic interplay between
  these two major global ocean stressors in the Anthropocene. In summer, however,
  viral-mediated carbon release rates were lower and not affected by lowered pH. Eutrophication
  consistently stimulated viral production regardless of the season or initial conditions.
  Given the relevant role of viruses for marine carbon cycling and the biological
  carbon pump, these two anthropogenic stressors may modulate carbon fluxes through
  their effect on viruses at the base of the pelagic food web in a future global change
  scenario.
