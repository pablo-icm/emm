abstract: Environmental DNA and culture-based analyses have suggested that fungi are
  present in low diversity and in low abundance in many marine environments, especially
  in the upper water column. Here, we use a dual approach involving high-throughput
  diversity tag sequencing from both DNA and RNA templates and fluorescent cell counts
  to evaluate the diversity and relative abundance of fungi across marine samples
  taken from six European near-shore sites. We removed very rare fungal operational
  taxonomic units (OTUs) selecting only OTUs recovered from multiple samples for a
  detailed analysis. This approach identified a set of 71 fungal ‘OTU clusters' that
  account for 66% of all the sequences assigned to the Fungi. Phylogenetic analyses
  demonstrated that this diversity includes a significant number of chytrid-like lineages
  that had not been previously described, indicating that the marine environment encompasses
  a number of zoosporic fungi that are new to taxonomic inventories. Using the sequence
  datasets, we identified cases where fungal OTUs were sampled across multiple geographical
  sites and between different sampling depths. This was especially clear in one relatively
  abundant and diverse phylogroup tentatively named Novel Chytrid-Like-Clade 1 (NCLC1).
  For comparison, a subset of the water column samples was also investigated using
  fluorescent microscopy to examine the abundance of eukaryotes with chitin cell walls.
  Comparisons of relative abundance of RNA-derived fungal tag sequences and chitin
  cell-wall counts demonstrate that fungi constitute a low fraction of the eukaryotic
  community in these water column samples. Taken together, these results demonstrate
  the phylogenetic position and environmental distribution of 71 lineages, improving
  our understanding of the diversity and abundance of fungi in marine environments.
