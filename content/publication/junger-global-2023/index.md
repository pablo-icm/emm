abstract: Tiny ocean plankton (picoplankton) are fundamental for the functioning of
  the biosphere, but the ecological mechanisms shaping their biogeography were partially
  understood. Comprehending whether these microorganisms are structured by niche versus
  neutral processes is relevant in the context of global change. We investigate the
  ecological processes (selection, dispersal, and drift) structuring global-ocean
  picoplanktonic communities inhabiting the epipelagic (0 to 200 meters), mesopelagic
  (200 to 1000 meters), and bathypelagic (1000 to 4000 meters) zones. We found that
  selection decreased, while dispersal limitation increased with depth, possibly due
  to differences in habitat heterogeneity and dispersal barriers such as water masses
  and bottom topography. Picoplankton β-diversity positively correlated with environmental
  heterogeneity and water mass variability, but this relationship tended to be weaker
  for eukaryotes than for prokaryotes. Community patterns were more pronounced in
  the Mediterranean Sea, probably because of its cross-basin environmental heterogeneity
  and deep-water isolation. We conclude that different combinations of ecological
  mechanisms shape the biogeography of the ocean microbiome across depths. ,  Ecological
  processes shaping the structure of the ocean microbiome change from the surface
  to the deep sea.
