abstract: Summary  Syndiniales are a parasitic order within the eukaryotic lineage
  Dinophyceae ( Alveolata ). Here, we analysed the taxonomy of this group using 43655
  18S rRNA gene sequences obtained either from environmental data sets or cultures,
  including 6874 environmental sequences from this study derived from Atlantic and
  Mediterranean waters. A total of 5571 out of the 43655 sequences analysed fell within
  the Dinophyceae . Both bayesian and maximum likelihood phylogenies placed Syndiniales
  in five main groups (I–V), as a monophyletic lineage at the base of ‘core’ dinoflagellates
  (all Dinophyceae except Syndiniales ), although the latter placement was not bootstrap
  supported. Thus, the two uncultured novel marine alveolate groups I and II, which
  have been highlighted previously, are confirmed to belong to the Syndiniales . These
  groups were the most diverse and highly represented in environmental studies. Within
  each, 8 and 44 clades were identified respectively. Co-evolutionary trends between
  parasitic Syndiniales and their putative hosts were not clear, suggesting they may
  be relatively ‘general’ parasitoids. Based on the overall distribution patterns
  of the Syndiniales -affiliated sequences, we propose that Syndiniales are exclusively
  marine. Interestingly, sequences belonging to groups II, III and V were largely
  retrieved from the photic zone, while Group I dominated samples from anoxic and
  suboxic ecosystems. Nevertheless, both groups I and II contained specific clades
  preferentially, or exclusively, retrieved from these latter ecosystems. Given the
  broad distribution of Syndiniales , our work indicates that parasitism may be a
  major force in ocean food webs, a force that is neglected in current conceptualizations
  of the marine carbon cycle.
