abstract: We present surface estimates of bacterial respiration, bacterial heterotrophic
  production (BHP), and bacterial growth efficiency (BGE), and their relationship
  with nutrient availability, along a trophic gradient from coastal upwelling waters
  to the open‐ocean waters of the eastern North Atlantic. Bacterial respiration generally
  ranged between 10 and 30 µg C L −1 d −1 and was relatively unaffected by nutrient
  enrichment. In contrast, BHP showed higher variability (more than one order‐of‐magnitude
  range) and was affected by carbon and/or phosphorus additions in different regions.
  Empirical bacterial carbon‐to‐leucine (Leu) conversion factors (CFs) (range, 0.02–1.29
  kg C mol Leu −1 ) decreased from the coast to the open ocean, largely influencing
  the BHP estimates in oligotrophic waters. We found high percentages of Leu respiration
  in oceanic waters (average 68% of Leu taken up by bacteria), possibly related to
  the low CFs found offshore. Empirical CFs were highly correlated to BGE (Pearson
  correlation coefficient r = 0.86, n = 12, p textless 0.0004, log‐log transformed),
  which varied between 1% in offshore waters and 56% in the upwelling waters. Empirical
  CFs could be critical not only for accurately constraining BHP, but probably also
  for predicting BGE in oceanic waters.
