abstract: 'Summary  The use of inorganic phosphate (Pi) and dissolved organic phosphorus
  (DOP) by different bacterial groups was studied in experimental mesocosms of P‐starved
  eastern Mediterranean waters in the absence (control mesocosms) and presence of
  additional Pi (P‐amended mesocosms). The low Pi turnover times in the control mesocosms
  and the increase in heterotrophic prokaryotic abundance and production upon Pi addition
  confirmed that the bacterial community was originally P‐limited. The bacterioplankton
  groups taking up Pi and DOP were identified by means of microautoradiography combined
  with catalysed reporter deposition fluorescence in situ hybridization. Incubations
  with leucine were also performed for comparative purposes. All the probe‐identified
  groups showed a high percentage of cells taking up Pi and DOP in the control, P‐limited,
  mesocosms throughout the experiment. However, in response to Pi addition two contrasting
  scenarios in Pi use were observed: (i) on day 1 of the experiment Pi addition caused
  a clear reduction in the percentage of SAR11 cells taking up Pi, whereas Gammaproteobacteria
  , Roseobacter and Bacteroidetes showed similar percentages to the ones in the control
  mesocosms and (ii) on day 4 of the experiment, probably when the bacterial community
  had fully responded to the P input, all the probe‐identified groups showed low percentages
  of cells taking up the substrate as compared with the control mesocosms. These differences
  are likely related to different P requirements among the bacterial groups and point
  out to the existence of two contrasting strategies in P use.'
