abstract: Summary  The aerobic anoxygenic phototrophic (AAP) bacteria are common in
  most marine environments but their global diversity and biogeography remain poorly
  characterized. Here, we analyzed AAP communities across 113 globally‐distributed
  surface ocean stations sampled during the Malaspina Expedition in the tropical and
  subtropical ocean. By means of amplicon sequencing of the puf M gene, a genetic
  marker for this functional group, we show that AAP communities along the surface
  ocean were mainly composed of members of the Halieaceae (Gammaproteobacteria), which
  were adapted to a large range of environmental conditions, and of different clades
  of the Alphaproteobacteria, which seemed to dominate under particular circumstances,
  such as in the oligotrophic gyres. AAP taxa were spatially structured within each
  of the studied oceans, with communities from adjacent stations sharing more taxonomic
  similarities. AAP communities were composed of a large pool of rare members and
  several habitat specialists. When compared to the surface ocean prokaryotic and
  picoeukaryotic communities, it appears that AAP communities display an idiosyncratic
  global biogeographical pattern, dominated by selection processes and less influenced
  by dispersal limitation. Our study contributes to the understanding of how AAP communities
  are distributed in the horizontal dimension and the mechanisms underlying their
  distribution across the global surface ocean.
