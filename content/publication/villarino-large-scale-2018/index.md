abstract: Abstract Global patterns of planktonic diversity are mainly determined by
  the dispersal of propagules with ocean currents. However, the role that abundance
  and body size play in determining spatial patterns of diversity remains unclear.
  Here we analyse spatial community structure - β-diversity - for several planktonic
  and nektonic organisms from prokaryotes to small mesopelagic fishes collected during
  the Malaspina 2010 Expedition. β-diversity was compared to surface ocean transit
  times derived from a global circulation model, revealing a significant negative
  relationship that is stronger than environmental differences. Estimated dispersal
  scales for different groups show a negative correlation with body size, where less
  abundant large-bodied communities have significantly shorter dispersal scales and
  larger species spatial turnover rates than more abundant small-bodied plankton.
  Our results confirm that the dispersal scale of planktonic and micro-nektonic organisms
  is determined by local abundance, which scales with body size, ultimately setting
  global spatial patterns of diversity.
