abstract: Abstract  Bacteroidetes is one of the dominant phyla of ocean bacterioplankton,
  yet its diversity and population structure is poorly understood. To advance in the
  delineation of ecologically meaningful units within this group, we constructed near
  full-length 16S rRNA gene clone libraries from contrasting marine environments in
  the NW Mediterranean. Based on phylogeny and the associated ecological variables
  (depth and season), 24 different Bacteroidetes clades were delineated. By considering
  their relative abundance (from iTag amplicon sequencing studies), we described the
  distribution patterns of each of these clades, delimiting them as Ecologically Significant
  Taxonomic Units (ESTUs). Spatially, there was almost no overlap among ESTUs at different
  depths. In deep waters there was predominance of Owenweeksia, Leeuwenhoekiella ,
  Muricauda -related genera, and some depth-associated ESTUs within the NS5 and NS2b
  marine clades. Seasonally, multi-annual dynamics of recurring ESTUs were present
  with dominance of some ESTUs within the NS4, NS5 and NS2b marine clades along most
  of the year, but with variable relative frequencies between months. A drastic change
  towards the predominance of Formosa -related ESTUs and one ESTU from the NS5 marine
  clade was typically present after the spring bloom. Even though there are no isolates
  available for these ESTUs to determine their physiology, correlation analyses identified
  the environmental preference of some of them. Overall, our results suggest that
  there is a high degree of niche specialisation within these closely related clades.
  This work constitutes a step forward in disentangling the ecology of marine Bacteroidetes,
  which are essential players in organic matter processing in the oceans.
