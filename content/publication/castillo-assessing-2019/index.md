abstract: Abstract  Viruses are the most abundant biological entities on Earth and
  have fundamental ecological roles in controlling microbial communities. Yet, although
  their diversity is being increasingly explored, little is known about the extent
  of viral interactions with their protist hosts as most studies are limited to a
  few cultivated species. Here, we exploit the potential of single‐cell genomics to
  unveil viral associations in 65 individual cells of 11 essentially uncultured stramenopiles
  lineages sampled during the Tara Oceans expedition. We identified viral signals
  in 57% of the cells, covering nearly every lineage and with narrow host specificity
  signal. Only seven out of the 64 detected viruses displayed homologies to known
  viral sequences. A search for our viral sequences in global ocean metagenomes showed
  that they were preferentially found at the DCM and within the 0.2–3 µm size fraction.
  Some of the viral signals were widely distributed, while others geographically constrained.
  Among the viral signals we detected an endogenous mavirus virophage potentially
  integrated within the nuclear genome of two distant uncultured stramenopiles. Virophages
  have been previously reported as a cell's defence mechanism against other viruses,
  and may therefore play an important ecological role in regulating protist populations.
  Our results point to single‐cell genomics as a powerful tool to investigate viral
  associations in uncultured protists, suggesting a wide distribution of these relationships,
  and providing new insights into the global viral diversity.
