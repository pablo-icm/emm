abstract: Abstract Ciliates are globally distributed eukaryotic organisms inhabiting
  virtually all environments on Earth. Although ciliates range from 10 µm to a few
  millimetres in cell size, they are repeatedly reported in the pico‐sized fraction
  (textless2–3 µm) of molecular surveys. Here, we used existing data sets (BioMarKs
  and Tara Oceans) with different size fractions to demonstrate that the ciliate pico‐sized
  signal, probably derived from cell breakage during filtration, is informative and
  reliable to study marine ciliate biodiversity and biogeography. We then used sequences
  from the pico‐eukaryotic fraction of two circumnavigation expeditions, Malaspina‐2010
  and Tara Oceans, to give insights into the taxonomic composition and horizontal
  and vertical distribution of ciliates in the global ocean. The results suggested
  a high homogeneity of ciliate communities along the ocean surface from temperate
  to tropical waters, with ciliate assemblages dominated by a few abundant and widely
  distributed taxa. Very few taxa were found in a single oceanic region, therefore
  suggesting a high level of ciliate cosmopolitanism in the global ocean. In vertical
  profiles, ciliates were detected up to 4,000 m depth, and a clear vertical community
  structuring was observed. Our results provided evidence supporting ciliates as deeply
  integrated organisms in the deep‐sea trophic web, where they may play a relevant
  role as symbionts of metazoans and grazers of prokaryotes and small eukaryotes in
  the water column and in aggregates.
