abstract: "Abstract
Ciliates are globally distributed eukaryotic organisms inhabiting virtually all environments on Earth. Although ciliates range from 10 µm to a few millimetres in cell size, they are repeatedly reported in the pico-sized fraction (\textless2–3 µm) of molecular surveys. Here, we used existing data sets (BioMarKs and Tara Oceans) with different size fractions to demonstrate that the ciliate pico-sized signal, probably derived from cell breakage during filtration, is informative and reliable to study marine ciliate biodiversity and biogeography. We then used sequences from the pico-eukaryotic fraction of two circumnavigation expeditions, Malaspina-2010 and Tara Oceans, to give insights into the taxonomic composition and horizontal and vertical distribution of ciliates in the global ocean. The results suggested a high homogeneity of ciliate communities along the ocean surface from temperate to tropical waters, with ciliate assemblages dominated by a few abundant and widely distributed taxa. Very few taxa were found in a single oceanic region, therefore suggesting a high level of ciliate cosmopolitanism in the global ocean. In vertical profiles, ciliates were detected up to 4,000 m depth, and a clear vertical community structuring was observed. Our results provided evidence supporting ciliates as deeply integrated organisms in the deep-sea trophic web, where they may play a relevant role as symbionts of metazoans and grazers of prokaryotes and small eukaryotes in the water column and in aggregates."
