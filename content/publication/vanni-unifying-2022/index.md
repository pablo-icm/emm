abstract: Genes of unknown function are among the biggest challenges in molecular
  biology, especially in microbial systems, where 40–60% of the predicted genes are
  unknown. Despite previous attempts, systematic approaches to include the unknown
  fraction into analytical workflows are still lacking. Here, we present a conceptual
  framework, its translation into the computational workflow AGNOSTOS and a demonstration
  on how we can bridge the known-unknown gap in genomes and metagenomes. By analyzing
  415,971,742 genes predicted from 1749 metagenomes and 28,941 bacterial and archaeal
  genomes, we quantify the extent of the unknown fraction, its diversity, and its
  relevance across multiple organisms and environments. The unknown sequence space
  is exceptionally diverse, phylogenetically more conserved than the known fraction
  and predominantly taxonomically restricted at the species level. From the 71 M genes
  identified to be of unknown function, we compiled a collection of 283,874 lineage-specific
  genes of unknown function for Cand. Patescibacteria (also known as Candidate Phyla
  Radiation, CPR), which provides a significant resource to expand our understanding
  of their unusual biology. Finally, by identifying a target gene of unknown function
  for antibiotic resistance, we demonstrate how we can enable the generation of hypotheses
  that can be used to augment experimental data.
