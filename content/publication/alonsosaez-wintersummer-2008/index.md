abstract: "Summary

We collected surface samples in Franklin Bay (Western Arctic) from ice‐covered to ice‐free conditions, to determine seasonal changes in the identity and
in situ
activity of the prokaryotic assemblages. Catalysed reported fluorescence
in situ
hybridization was used to quantify the abundance of different groups, and combined with microautoradiography to determine the fraction of active cells taking up three substrates: glucose, amino acids and ATP. In surface waters,
Archaea
accounted for 16% of the total cell count in winter, but decreased to almost undetectable levels in summer, when
Bacteria
made up 97% of the total cell count.
Alphaproteobacteria
were the most abundant group followed by
Bacteroidetes
(average of 34% and 14% of total cell counts respectively). Some bacterial groups appearing in low abundances (\textless 10% of total cell counts), such as
Betaproteobacteria
,
Roseobacter
and
Gammaproteobacteria
, showed a high percentage of active cells. By contrast, more abundant groups, such as SAR11 or
Bacteroidetes
, had a lower percentage of active cells in the uptake of the substrates tested.
Archaea
showed low heterotrophic activity throughout the year. In comparison with temperate oceans, the percentage of active
Bacteria
in the uptake of the substrates was relatively high, even during the winter season."
