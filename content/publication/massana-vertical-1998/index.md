abstract: A station located in the Gerlache Strait (Antarctic Peninsula) was sampled
  during early spring to determine the vertical distribution of marine planktonic
  archaea and to further describe the dynamic environment where they live. Chlorophyll
  concentration indicated that sampling occurred during the early stages of austral
  spring algal development. As expected, prokaryote abundance was higher at surface
  than at depth, and prokaryotic activity estimated by leucine incorporation was low
  at the surface and extremely low at 500 m. The relative abundance of planktonic
  archaeal, eucaryal, and bacterial ribosomal RNA was determined by quantitative rRNA
  hybridization, and the performance of two different universal probes used to normalize
  group‚Äêspecific probe hybridization response was compared. Archaeal rRNA was detected
  in all samples analyzed, and was more abundant at depth (up to 25% of total rRNA)
  than at the surface. In both years, the archaeal signal decreased during the sampling
  period, particularly at surface. Most of the archaeal signal was attributable to
  group I archaea, affiliated with the kingdom Crenarchaeota. Planktonic euryarchaeotes
  (group II archaea) showed a larger contribution to the archaeal assemblage in surface
  waters than at depth. In total, our results verify that planktonic archaea are dynamic
  and abundant components in marine picoplankton assemblages of the Antarctic Peninsula.
