abstract: 'Abstract How much temporal recurrence is present in microbial assemblages
  is still an unanswered ecological question. Even though marked seasonal changes
  have been reported for whole microbial communities, less is known on the dynamics
  and seasonality of individual taxa. Here, we aim at understanding microbial recurrence
  at three different levels: community, taxonomic group and operational taxonomic
  units (OTUs). For that, we focused on a model microbial eukaryotic community populating
  a long‐term marine microbial observatory using 18S rRNA gene data from two organismal
  size fractions: the picoplankton (0.2–3 µm) and the nanoplankton (3–20 µm). We have
  developed an index to quantify recurrence in particular taxa. We found that community
  structure oscillated systematically between two main configurations corresponding
  to winter and summer over the 10 years studied. A few taxonomic groups such as Mamiellophyceae
  or MALV‐III presented clear recurrence (i.e., seasonality), whereas 13%–19% of the
  OTUs in both size fractions, accounting for ~40% of the relative abundance, featured
  recurrent dynamics. Altogether, our work links long‐term whole community dynamics
  with that of individual OTUs and taxonomic groups, indicating that recurrent and
  non‐recurrent changes characterize the dynamics of microbial assemblages. ,   see
  also the Perspective by Moreira and López‐García'
