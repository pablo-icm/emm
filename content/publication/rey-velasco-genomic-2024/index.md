abstract: 'Prokaryotes dominate global oceans and shape biogeochemical cycles, yet
  most taxa remain uncultured and uncharacterized as of today. Here we present the
  characterization of 26 novel marine bacterial strains from a large isolate collection
  obtained from Blanes Bay (NW Mediterranean) microcosm experiments made in the four
  seasons. Morphological, cultural, biochemical, physiological, nutritional, genomic,
  and phylogenomic analyses were used to characterize and phylogenetically place the
  novel isolates. The strains represent 23 novel bacterial species and six novel genera:
  three novel species pertaining to class Alphaproteobacteria (families Rhodobacteraceae
  and Sphingomonadaceae ), six novel species and three new genera from class Gammaproteobacteria
  (families Algiphilaceae , Salinispheraceae , and Alteromonadaceae ), 13 novel species
  and three novel genera from class Bacteroidia (family Flavobacteriaceae ), and one
  new species from class Rhodothermia (family Rubricoccaceae ). The bacteria described
  here have potentially relevant roles in the cycles of carbon (e.g., carbon fixation
  or energy production via proteorhodopsin), nitrogen (e.g., denitrification or use
  of urea), sulfur (oxidation of sulfur compounds), phosphorus (acquisition and use
  of different forms of phosphorus and remodeling of membrane phospholipids), and
  hydrogen (oxidation of hydrogen to obtain energy). We mapped the genomes of the
  presented strains to the Tara Oceans metagenomes to reveal that these strains were
  globally distributed, with those of the family Flavobacteriaceae being the most
  widespread and abundant, while Rhodothermia being the rarest and most localized.
  While molecular-only approaches are also important, our study stresses the importance
  of culturing as a powerful tool to further understand the functioning of marine
  bacterial communities.'
