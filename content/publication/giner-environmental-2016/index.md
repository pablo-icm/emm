abstract: 'ABSTRACT  High-throughput sequencing (HTS) is revolutionizing environmental
  surveys of microbial diversity in the three domains of life by providing detailed
  information on which taxa are present in microbial assemblages. However, it is still
  unclear how the relative abundance of specific taxa gathered by HTS correlates with
  cell abundances. Here, we quantified the relative cell abundance of 6 picoeukaryotic
  taxa in 13 planktonic samples from 6 European coastal sites using epifluorescence
  microscopy on tyramide signal amplification-fluorescence in situ hybridization preparations.
  These relative abundance values were then compared with HTS data obtained in three
  separate molecular surveys: 454 sequencing of the V4 region of the 18S ribosomal
  DNA (rDNA) using DNA and RNA extracts (DNA-V4 and cDNA-V4) and Illumina sequencing
  of the V9 region (cDNA-V9). The microscopic and molecular signals were generally
  correlated, indicating that a relative increase in specific 18S rDNA was the result
  of a large proportion of cells in the given taxa. Despite these positive correlations,
  the slopes often deviated from 1, precluding a direct translation of sequences to
  cells. Our data highlighted clear differences depending on the nucleic acid template
  or the 18S rDNA region targeted. Thus, the molecular signal obtained using cDNA
  templates was always closer to relative cell abundances, while the V4 and V9 regions
  gave better results depending on the taxa. Our data support the quantitative use
  of HTS data but warn about considering it as a direct proxy of cell abundances.   IMPORTANCE
  Direct studies on marine picoeukaryotes by epifluorescence microscopy are problematic
  due to the lack of morphological features and due to the limited number and poor
  resolution of specific phylogenetic probes used in fluorescence in situ hybridization
  (FISH) routines. As a consequence, there is an increasing use of molecular methods,
  including high-throughput sequencing (HTS), to study marine microbial diversity.
  HTS can provide a detailed picture of the taxa present in a community and can reveal
  diversity not evident using other methods, but it is still unclear what the meaning
  of the sequence abundance in a given taxon is. Our aim is to investigate the correspondence
  between the relative HTS signal and relative cell abundances in selected picoeukaryotic
  taxa. Environmental sequencing provides reasonable estimates of the relative abundance
  of specific taxa. Better results are obtained when using RNA extracts as the templates,
  while the region of 18S ribosomal DNA had different influences depending on the
  taxa assayed.'
