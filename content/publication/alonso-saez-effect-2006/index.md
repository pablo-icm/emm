abstract: ABSTRACT  We studied the effects of natural sunlight on heterotrophic marine
  bacterioplankton in short-term experiments. We used a single-cell level approach
  involving flow cytometry combined with physiological probes and microautoradiography
  to determine sunlight effects on the activity and integrity of the cells. After
  4 h of sunlight exposure, most bacterial cells maintained membrane integrity and
  viability as assessed by the simultaneous staining with propidium iodide and SYBR
  green I. In contrast, a significant inhibition of heterotrophic bacterial activity
  was detected, measured by 5-cyano-2,3 ditolyl tetrazolium chloride reduction and
  leucine incorporation. We applied microautoradiography combined with catalyzed reporter
  deposition-fluorescence in situ hybridization to test the sensitivity of the different
  bacterial groups naturally occurring in the Northwestern Mediterranean to sunlight.
  Members of the Gammaproteobacteria and Bacteroidetes groups appeared to be highly
  resistant to solar radiation, with small changes in activity after exposure. On
  the contrary, Alphaproteobacteria bacteria were more sensitive to radiation as measured
  by the cell-specific incorporation of labeled amino acids, leucine, and ATP. Within
  Alphaproteobacteria , bacteria belonging to the Roseobacter group showed higher
  resistance than members of the SAR11 cluster. The activity of Roseobacter was stimulated
  by exposure to photosynthetic available radiation compared to the dark treatment.
  Our results suggest that UV radiation can significantly affect the in situ single-cell
  activity of bacterioplankton and that naturally dominating phylogenetic bacterial
  groups have different sensitivity to natural levels of incident solar radiation.
