abstract: 'We investigated the patterns in bacterial growth, production, respiration,
  growth efficiency (BGE), and bacterial leucine respiration and C-to-leucine yield
  (i.e., conversion factor [CF]) along a transect off the coast of Oregon. Plankton
  respiration along the transect averaged 1.15 ± 0.16 mg C L −1 h −1 , peaking in
  the coastal upwelling region. The respiration in the filtered fraction, which was
  dominated by bacterial biomass, accounted for 79% of the total respiration. The
  different approaches that we used converged to an average BGE of 13% ± 1%, with
  peaks of over 20% in the more productive coastal areas and values declining to below
  5% toward the oligotrophic gyre waters. There was overall coherence between the
  various aspects of bacterial C metabolism: communities with low BGE also tended
  to have low growth rates and high leucine-to-thymidine incorporation ratios. The
  patterns in BGE were mirrored at the single compound level, and in the most oligotrophic
  sites, bacteria tended to quickly respire a large fraction (20–75%) of the leucine
  that was taken up and had the lowest C-to-leucine yield, suggesting that the patterns
  in bulk BGE and growth also apply to individual substrates. Bacterial growth was
  a function of both C consumption and BGE; these two aspects of bacterial C metabolism
  do not necessarily covary, and they are regulated differently. The patterns in C
  consumption, growth, BGE, and leucine metabolism all reflect the basic physiological
  response of bacteria to energy limitation due to high maintenance costs associated
  with life in oligotrophy.'
