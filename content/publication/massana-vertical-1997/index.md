abstract: Newly described phylogenetic lineages within the domain Archaea have recently
  been found to be significant components of marine picoplankton assemblages. To better
  understand the ecology of these microorganisms, we investigated the relative abundance,
  distribution, and phylogenetic composition of Archaea in the Santa Barbara Channel.
  Significant amounts of archaeal rRNA and rDNA (genes coding for rRNA) were detected
  in all samples analyzed. The relative abundance of archaeal rRNA as measured by
  quantitative oligonucleotide hybridization experiments was low in surface waters
  but reached higher values (20 to 30% of prokaryotic rRNA) at depths below 100 m.
  Probes were developed for the two major groups of marine Archaea detected. rRNA
  originating from the euryarchaeal group (group II) was most abundant in surface
  waters, whereas rRNA from the crenarchaeal group (group I) dominated at depth. Clone
  libraries of PCR-amplified archaeal rRNA genes were constructed with samples from
  0 and 200 m deep. Screening of libraries by hybridization with specific oligonucleotide
  probes, as well as subsequent sequencing of the cloned genes, indicated that virtually
  all archaeal rDNA clones recovered belonged to one of the two groups. The recovery
  of cloned rDNA sequence types in depth profiles exhibited the same trends as were
  observed in quantitative rRNA hybridization experiments. One representative of each
  of 18 distinct restriction fragment length polymorphism types was partially sequenced.
  Recovered sequences spanned most of the previously reported phylogenetic diversity
  detected in planktonic crenarchaeal and euryarchaeal groups. Several rDNA sequences
  appeared to be harbored in archaeal types which are widely distributed in marine
  coastal waters. In total, data suggest that marine planktonic crenarchaea and euryarchaea
  of temperate coastal habitats thrive in different zones of the water column. The
  relative rRNA abundance of the crenarchaeal group suggests that its members constitute
  a significant fraction of the prokaryotic biomass in subsurface coastal waters.
