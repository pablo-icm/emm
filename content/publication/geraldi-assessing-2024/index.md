abstract: Documenting large-scale patterns of animals in the ocean and determining
  the drivers of these patterns is needed for conservation efforts given the unprecedented
  rates of change occurring within marine ecosystems. We used existing datasets from
  two global expeditions, Tara Oceans and Malaspina , that circumnavigated the oceans
  and sampled down to 4000 m to assess metazoans from environmental DNA (eDNA) extracted
  from seawater. We describe patterns of taxonomic richness within metazoan phyla
  and orders based on metabarcoding and infer the relative abundance of phyla using
  metagenome datasets, and relate these data to environmental variables. Arthropods
  had the greatest taxonomic richness of metazoan phyla at the surface, while cnidarians
  had the greatest richness in pelagic zones. Half of the marine metazoan eDNA from
  metagenome datasets was from arthropods, followed by cnidarians and nematodes. We
  found that mean surface temperature and primary productivity were positively related
  to metazoan taxonomic richness. Our findings concur with existing knowledge that
  temperature and primary productivity are important drivers of taxonomic richness
  for specific taxa at the ocean’s surface, but these correlations are less evident
  in the deep ocean. Massive sequencing of eDNA can improve understanding of animal
  distributions, particularly for the deep ocean where sampling is challenging.
