abstract: 'Summary  We explored how marine dissolved organic matter ( DOM ) altered
  by bacterial growth and protozoan grazing modify the metabolism of Southeastern
  Cantabrian Sea ( CS ) and NW M editerranean Sea ( MS ) coastal bacterial communities.
  Major metabolic features were measured in treatments with half of the natural water
  replaced by water with different DOM quality, characterized by fluorescent DOM analysis
  and collected from key times of the predator–prey curve. In both ecosystems, protozoan‐altered
  DOM led to similar increases in bacterial carbon demand (238% and 213%) and decreases
  in bacterial growth efficiency ( BGE : 56% for the CS and 46% for the MS ). These
  low BGEs were caused by similar bacterial production but much higher bacterial respiration
  rates, which in turn were positively related to aminopeptidase activity. However,
  in the CS bacterial community dominated by Bacteroidetes (41%), the enhanced hydrolytic
  activity was produced at a lower metabolic cost than in the MS , dominated by SAR
  11 (47%), which suggests a better adaptation of Bacteroidetes to the DOM altered
  during protozoan grazing. These results highlight protozoan grazing as a relevant
  factor influencing BGE in coastal ecosystems, and relate bacterial community composition
  to the major metabolic processes that result after a change in the quality of marine
  DOM .'
