abstract: "Summary

We explored how marine dissolved organic matter (
DOM
) altered by bacterial growth and protozoan grazing modify the metabolism of Southeastern Cantabrian Sea (
CS
) and
NW M
editerranean Sea (
MS
) coastal bacterial communities. Major metabolic features were measured in treatments with half of the natural water replaced by water with different
DOM
quality, characterized by fluorescent
DOM
analysis and collected from key times of the predator–prey curve. In both ecosystems, protozoan-altered
DOM
led to similar increases in bacterial carbon demand (238% and 213%) and decreases in bacterial growth efficiency (
BGE
: 56% for the
CS
and 46% for the
MS
). These low
BGEs
were caused by similar bacterial production but much higher bacterial respiration rates, which in turn were positively related to aminopeptidase activity. However, in the
CS
bacterial community dominated by
Bacteroidetes
(41%), the enhanced hydrolytic activity was produced at a lower metabolic cost than in the
MS
, dominated by
SAR
11 (47%), which suggests a better adaptation of
Bacteroidetes
to the
DOM
altered during protozoan grazing. These results highlight protozoan grazing as a relevant factor influencing
BGE
in coastal ecosystems, and relate bacterial community composition to the major metabolic processes that result after a change in the quality of marine
DOM
."
