              Background
              Microbial interactions are fundamental for Earth’s ecosystem functioning and biogeochemical cycling. Nevertheless, they are challenging to identify and remain barely known. Omics-based censuses are helpful in predicting microbial interactions through the statistical inference of single (static) association networks. Yet, microbial interactions are dynamic and we have limited knowledge of how they change over time. Here, we investigate the dynamics of microbial associations in a 10-year marine time series in the Mediterranean Sea using an approach inferring a time-resolved (temporal) network from a single static network.
            
            
              Results
              A single static network including microbial eukaryotes and bacteria was built using metabarcoding data derived from 120 monthly samples. For the decade, we aimed to identify persistent, seasonal, and temporary microbial associations by determining a temporal network that captures the interactome of each individual sample. We found that the temporal network appears to follow an annual cycle, collapsing, and reassembling when transiting between colder and warmer waters. We observed higher association repeatability in colder than in warmer months. Only 16 associations could be validated using observations reported in literature, underlining our knowledge gap in marine microbial ecological interactions.
            
            
              Conclusions
              Our results indicate that marine microbial associations follow recurrent temporal dynamics in temperate zones, which need to be accounted for to better understand the functioning of the ocean microbiome. The constructed marine temporal network may serve as a resource for testing season-specific microbial interaction hypotheses. The applied approach can be transferred to microbiome studies in other ecosystems.},

              Background
              Viruses play important roles in the ocean’s biogeochemical cycles. Yet, deep ocean viruses are one of the most under-explored fractions of the global biosphere. Little is known about the environmental factors that control the composition and functioning of their communities or how they interact with their free-living or particle-attached microbial hosts.
            
            
              Results
              We analysed 58 viral communities associated with size-fractionated free-living (0.2–0.8 μm) and particle-attached (0.8–20 μm) cellular metagenomes from bathypelagic (2150–4018 m deep) microbiomes obtained during the Malaspina expedition. These metagenomes yielded 6631 viral sequences, 91\% of which were novel, and 67 represented high-quality genomes. Taxonomic classification assigned 53\% of the viral sequences to families of tailed viruses from the order Caudovirales. Computational host prediction associated 886 viral sequences to dominant members of the deep ocean microbiome, such as Alphaproteobacteria (284), Gammaproteobacteria (241), SAR324 (23), Marinisomatota (39), and Chloroflexota (61). Free-living and particle-attached viral communities had markedly distinct taxonomic composition, host prevalence, and auxiliary metabolic gene content, which led to the discovery of novel viral-encoded metabolic genes involved in the folate and nucleotide metabolisms. Water mass age emerged as an important factor driving viral community composition. We postulated this was due to changes in quality and concentration of dissolved organic matter acting on the host communities, leading to an increase of viral auxiliary metabolic genes associated with energy metabolism among older water masses.
            
            
              Conclusions
              These results shed light on the mechanisms by which environmental gradients of deep ocean ecosystems structure the composition and functioning of free-living and particle-attached viral communities.},

During the past decade, high-throughput sequencing of DNA has been revolutionizing their study on an unprecedented scale. Nonetheless, it is currently unclear whether we can accurately, effectively, and quantitatively depict the microbial eukaryotic plankton community using size-fractionated filtration combined with environmental DNA (eDNA) molecular methods. Here we assessed the microbial eukaryotic plankton communities with two filtering strategies from two subtropical reservoirs, that is one-step filtration (0.2–200 μm) and size-fractionated filtration (0.2–3 and 3–200 μm). The difference of 18S rRNA gene copy abundance between the two filtering treatments was less than 50\% of the 0.2–200 μm microbial eukaryotic community for 95\% of the total samples. Although the microbial eukaryotic plankton communities within the 0.2–200 μm and the 0.2–3 and 3–200 μm size fractions had approximately identical 18S rRNA gene copies, there were significant differences in their community composition. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that the systemic bias introduced by size-fractionation filtration has more influence on unique OTUs than shared OTUs, and the significant differences in abundance between the two eukaryotic plankton communities largely occurred in low-abundance OTUs in specific seasons. This work provides new insights into the use of size-fractionation in molecular studies of microbial eukaryotes populating the plankton.},

              Grazing controls bacterial abundances and composition in many ecosystems. In marine systems, heterotrophic flagellates (HFs) are important predators. Assemblages of HFs are primarily formed by species still uncultured; therefore, many aspects of their trophic behaviour are poorly known. Here, we assessed the functional response of the whole assemblage and of four taxa grown in an unamended seawater incubation. We used fluorescently labelled bacteria to create a prey gradient of two orders of magnitude in abundance and estimated ingestion rates. Natural HFs had a half‐saturation constant of 6.7 × 10
              5
              prey ml
              −1
              , a value lower than that of cultured flagellates and within the range of marine planktonic bacterial abundances.
              Minorisa minuta
              was well adapted to low prey abundances and very efficient in ingesting bacteria. MAST‐4 and MAST‐7 were also well adapted to the typical marine abundances but less voracious. In contrast,
              Paraphysomonas imperforata
              , a typical cultured species, did not achieve ingestion rate saturation even at the highest prey concentration assayed. Our study, beside to set the basis for the fundamental differences between cultured and uncultured bacterial grazers, indicate that the examined predator taxa have different functional responses, suggesting that they occupy distinct ecological niches according to their grazing strategies and prey preferences.},

              Aim
              Dispersal and environmental gradients shape marine microbial communities, yet the relative importance of these factors across taxa with distinct sizes and dispersal capacity in different ocean layers is unknown. Here, we report a comparative analysis of surface and deep ocean microbial beta diversity and examine how these patterns are tied to oceanic distance and environmental gradients.
            
            
              Location
              Tropical and subtropical oceans (30°N–40°S).
            
            
              Time period
              2010–2011.
            
            
              Major taxa studied
              Prokaryotes and picoeukaryotes (eukaryotes between 0.2 and 3 μm).
            
            
              Methods
              Beta diversity was calculated from metabarcoding data on prokaryotic and picoeukaryotic microbes collected during the Malaspina expedition across the tropical and subtropical oceans. Mantel correlations were used to determine the relative contribution of environment and oceanic distance driving community beta diversity.
            
            
              Results
              Mean community similarity across all sites for prokaryotes was 38.9\% in the surface and 51.4\% in the deep ocean, compared to mean similarity of 25.8 and 12.1\% in the surface and deep ocean, respectively, for picoeukaryotes. Higher dispersal rates and smaller body sizes of prokaryotes relative to picoeukaryotes likely contributed to the significantly higher community similarity for prokaryotes compared with picoeukaryotes. The ecological mechanisms determining the biogeography of microbes varied across depth. In the surface ocean, the environmental differences in space were a more important factor driving microbial distribution compared with the oceanic distance, defined as the shortest path between two sites avoiding land. In the deep ocean, picoeukaryote communities were slightly more structured by the oceanic distance, while prokaryotes were shaped by the combined action of oceanic distance and environmental filtering.
            
            
              Main conclusions
              Horizontal gradients in microbial community assembly differed across ocean depths, as did mechanisms shaping them. In the deep ocean, the oceanic distance and environment played significant roles driving microbial spatial distribution, while in the surface the influence of the environment was stronger than oceanic distance.},

              The aerobic anoxygenic phototrophic (AAP) bacteria are common in most marine environments but their global diversity and biogeography remain poorly characterized. Here, we analyzed AAP communities across 113 globally‐distributed surface ocean stations sampled during the Malaspina Expedition in the tropical and subtropical ocean. By means of amplicon sequencing of the
              puf
              M gene, a genetic marker for this functional group, we show that AAP communities along the surface ocean were mainly composed of members of the Halieaceae (Gammaproteobacteria), which were adapted to a large range of environmental conditions, and of different clades of the Alphaproteobacteria, which seemed to dominate under particular circumstances, such as in the oligotrophic gyres. AAP taxa were spatially structured within each of the studied oceans, with communities from adjacent stations sharing more taxonomic similarities. AAP communities were composed of a large pool of rare members and several habitat specialists. When compared to the surface ocean prokaryotic and picoeukaryotic communities, it appears that AAP communities display an idiosyncratic global biogeographical pattern, dominated by selection processes and less influenced by dispersal limitation. Our study contributes to the understanding of how AAP communities are distributed in the horizontal dimension and the mechanisms underlying their distribution across the global surface ocean.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            The successful colonization of new habitats has played a fundamental role during the evolution of life. Salinity is one of the strongest barriers for organisms to cross, which has resulted in the evolution of distinct marine and non-marine (including both freshwater and soil) communities. Although microbes represent by far the vast majority of eukaryote diversity, the role of the salt barrier in shaping the diversity across the eukaryotic tree is poorly known. Traditional views suggest rare and ancient marine/non-marine transitions but this view is being challenged by the discovery of several recently transitioned lineages. Here, we investigate habitat evolution across the tree of eukaryotes using a unique set of taxon-rich phylogenies inferred from a combination of long-read and short-read environmental metabarcoding data spanning the ribosomal DNA operon. Our results show that, overall, marine and non-marine microbial communities are phylogenetically distinct but transitions have occurred in both directions in almost all major eukaryotic lineages, with hundreds of transition events detected. Some groups have experienced relatively high rates of transitions, most notably fungi for which crossing the salt barrier has probably been an important aspect of their successful diversification. At the deepest phylogenetic levels, ancestral habitat reconstruction analyses suggest that eukaryotes may have first evolved in non-marine habitats and that the two largest known eukaryotic assemblages (TSAR and Amorphea) arose in different habitats. Overall, our findings indicate that the salt barrier has played an important role during eukaryote evolution and provide a global perspective on habitat transitions in this domain of life.},

	abstract = {In marine ecosystems, most invertebrates possess diverse microbiomes on their external surfaces, such as those found in the pedal mucus of grazing gastropods and chitons that aids displacement on different surfaces. The microbes are then transported around and placed in contact with free-living microbial communities of micro and other macro-organisms, potentially exchanging species and homogenizing microbial composition and structure among grazer hosts. Here, we characterize the microbiota of the pedal mucus of five distantly related mollusk grazers, quantify differences in microbial community structure, mucus protein and carbohydrate content, and, through a simple laboratory experiment, assess their effects on integrated measures of biofilm abundance. Over 665 Amplicon Sequence Variants (ASVs) were found across grazers, with significant differences in abundance and composition among grazer species and epilithic biofilms. The pulmonate limpet
              Siphonaria lessonii
              and the periwinkle
              Echinolittorina peruviana
              shared similar microbiota. The microbiota of the chiton
              Chiton granosus,
              keyhole limpet
              Fissurella crassa,

              Scurria araucana
              differed markedly from one another, and form those of the pulmonate limpet and periwinkle. Flavobacteriaceae (Bacteroidia) and Colwelliaceae (Gammaproteobacteria) were the most common among microbial taxa. Microbial strict specialists were found in only one grazer species. The pedal mucus pH was similar among grazers, but carbohydrate and protein concentrations differed significantly. Yet, differences in mucus composition were not reflected in microbial community structure. Only the pedal mucus of
              F. crassa
              and
              S. lessonii
              negatively affected the abundance of photosynthetic microorganisms in the biofilm, demonstrating the specificity of the pedal mucus effects on biofilm communities. Thus, the pedal mucus microbiota are distinct among grazer hosts and can affect and interact non-trophically with the epilithic biofilms on which grazers feed, potentially leading to microbial community coalescence mediated by grazer movement. Further studies are needed to unravel the myriad of non-trophic interactions and their reciprocal impacts between macro- and microbial communities.},

            Subterranean estuaries are biogeochemically active coastal sites resulting from the underground mixing of fresh aquifer groundwater and seawater. In these systems, microbial activity can largely transform the chemical elements that may reach the sea through submarine groundwater discharge (SGD), but little is known about the microorganisms thriving in these land‐sea transition zones. We present the first spatially‐resolved characterization of the bacterial assemblages along a coastal aquifer in the NW Mediterranean, considering the entire subsurface salinity gradient. Combining bulk heterotrophic activity measurements, flow cytometry, microscopy and 16S rRNA gene sequencing we find large variations in prokaryotic abundances, cell size, activity and diversity at both the horizontal and vertical scales that reflect the pronounced physicochemical gradients. The parts of the transect most influenced by freshwater were characterized by smaller cells and lower prokaryotic abundances and heterotrophic production, but some activity hotspots were found at deep low‐oxygen saline groundwater sites enriched in nitrite and ammonium. Diverse, heterogeneous and highly endemic communities dominated by Proteobacteria, Patescibacteria, Desulfobacterota and Bacteroidota were observed throughout the aquifer, pointing to clearly differentiated prokaryotic niches across these transition zones and little microbial connectivity between groundwater and Mediterranean seawater habitats. Finally, experimental manipulations unveiled large increases in community heterotrophic activity driven by fast growth of some rare and site‐specific groundwater Proteobacteria. Our results indicate that prokaryotic communities within subterranean estuaries are highly heterogeneous in terms of biomass, activity and diversity, suggesting that their role in transforming nutrients will also vary spatially within these terrestrial–marine transition zones.},

              Background
              Ocean microbes constitute {\textasciitilde} 70\% of the marine biomass, are responsible for {\textasciitilde} 50\% of the Earth’s primary production and are crucial for global biogeochemical cycles. Marine microbiotas include core taxa that are usually key for ecosystem function. Despite their importance, core marine microbes are relatively unknown, which reflects the lack of consensus on how to identify them. So far, most core microbiotas have been defined based on species occurrence and abundance. Yet, species interactions are also important to identify core microbes, as communities include interacting species. Here, we investigate interconnected bacteria and small protists of the core pelagic microbiota populating a long-term marine-coastal observatory in the Mediterranean Sea over a decade.
            
            
              Results
              Core microbes were defined as those present in {\textgreater} 30\% of the monthly samples over 10 years, with the strongest associations. The core microbiota included 259 Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) including 182 bacteria, 77 protists, and 1411 strong and mostly positive ({\textasciitilde} 95\%) associations. Core bacteria tended to be associated with other bacteria, while core protists tended to be associated with bacteria. The richness and abundance of core OTUs varied annually, decreasing in stratified warmers waters and increasing in colder mixed waters. Most core OTUs had a preference for one season, mostly winter, which featured subnetworks with the highest connectivity. Groups of highly associated taxa tended to include protists and bacteria with predominance in the same season, particularly winter. A group of 13 highly-connected hub-OTUs, with potentially important ecological roles dominated in winter and spring. Similarly, 18 connector OTUs with a low degree but high centrality were mostly associated with summer or autumn and may represent transitions between seasonal communities.
            
            
              Conclusions
              We found a relatively small and dynamic interconnected core microbiota in a model temperate marine-coastal site, with potential interactions being more deterministic in winter than in other seasons. These core microbes would be essential for the functioning of this ecosystem over the year. Other non-core taxa may also carry out important functions but would be redundant and non-essential. Our work contributes to the understanding of the dynamics and potential interactions of core microbes possibly sustaining ocean ecosystem function.},

	abstract = {Trophic interactions between marine phytoplankton and heterotrophic bacteria are at the base of the biogeochemical carbon cycling in the ocean. However, the specific interactions taking place between phytoplankton and bacterial taxa remain largely unexplored, particularly out of phytoplankton blooming events. Here, we applied network analysis to a 3.5-year time-series dataset to assess the specific associations between different phytoplankton and bacterial taxa along the seasonal scale, distinguishing between free-living and particle-attached bacteria. Using a newly developed network post-analysis technique we removed bacteria-phytoplankton correlations that were primarily driven by environmental parameters, to detect potential biotic interactions. Our results indicate that phytoplankton dynamics may be a strong driver of the inter-annual variability in bacterial community composition. We found the highest abundance of specific bacteria-phytoplankton associations in the particle-attached fraction, indicating a tighter bacteria-phytoplankton association than in the free-living fraction. In the particle-associated fraction we unveiled novel potential associations such as the one between Planctomycetes taxa and the diatom

            Throughout coastal Antarctica, ice shelves separate oceanic waters from sunlight by hundreds of meters of ice. Historical studies have detected activity of nitrifying microorganisms in oceanic cavities below permanent ice shelves. However, little is known about the microbial composition and pathways that mediate these activities. In this study, we profiled the microbial communities beneath the Ross Ice Shelf using a multi-omics approach. Overall, beneath-shelf microorganisms are of comparable abundance and diversity, though distinct composition, relative to those in the open meso- and bathypelagic ocean. Production of new organic carbon is likely driven by aerobic lithoautotrophic archaea and bacteria that can use ammonium, nitrite, and sulfur compounds as electron donors. Also enriched were aerobic organoheterotrophic bacteria capable of degrading complex organic carbon substrates, likely derived from in situ fixed carbon and potentially refractory organic matter laterally advected by the below-shelf waters. Altogether, these findings uncover a taxonomically distinct microbial community potentially adapted to a highly oligotrophic marine environment and suggest that ocean cavity waters are primarily chemosynthetically-driven systems.},

The Antarctic Peninsula (AP) is affected by the greatest warming occurring in the Southern Ocean; changes in cryospheric and biological processes are being observed. Whilst there is some evidence that organic material produced by ice algae and/or phytoplankton in the high Arctic contributes to SSA, less is known about Antarctic Sea ice (sympagic) regions. To gain insight into the influence of Antarctic Sea ice biology and biogeochemistry on atmospheric aerosol, we report simultaneous water-air measurements made by means of
              in situ
              aerosol chamber experiments. For the first time, we present a methodology showing that the controlled plunging jet aerosol chamber settings do not cause major cell disruption on the studied sea ice ecosystems. Larger sea ice phytoplankton cells (\&gt;20 µm; mainly diatoms) tend to sediment at the bottom of the chamber (during the 24h experiment) and likely have a minor role on SSA production. When comparing four chamber experiments - we find that the two producing more SSA are the ones with highest abundance of nanophytoplankton cells (\&lt;20 µm; mainly nanoflagellates) as well as viruses. Our marine biogeochemical data show two broad groups of dissolved organic carbon: one rich in carbohydrates and proteic material and one rich in humic-like substances; the latter enhancing SSA production. This work provides unique insights into sea ice productivity that modulates SSA production, with potentially significant climate impacts. Further studies of these types are advised in order to see how microbiology impacts the biogeochemical cycling of elements and how aerosols are formed and processed in cold regions.},

            Bacteria display dynamic abundance fluctuations over time in marine environments, where they play key biogeochemical roles. Here, we characterized the seasonal dynamics of marine bacteria in a coastal oligotrophic time series station, tested how similar the temporal niche of closely related taxa is, and what are the environmental parameters modulating their seasonal abundance patterns. We further explored how conserved the niche is at higher taxonomic levels. The community presented recurrent patterns of seasonality for 297 out of 6825 amplicon sequence variants (ASVs), which constituted almost half of the total relative abundance (47\%). For certain genera, niche similarity decreased as nucleotide divergence in the 16S rRNA gene increased, a pattern compatible with the selection of similar taxa through environmental filtering. Additionally, we observed evidence of seasonal differentiation within various genera as seen by the distinct seasonal patterns of closely related taxa. At broader taxonomic levels, coherent seasonal trends did not exist at the class level, while the order and family ranks depended on the patterns that existed at the genus level. This study identifies the coexistence of closely related taxa for some bacterial groups and seasonal differentiation for others in a coastal marine environment subjected to a strong seasonality.},

              Pico‐ and nanoplankton are key players in the marine ecosystems due to their implication in the biogeochemical cycles, nutrient recycling and the pelagic food webs. However, the specific dynamics and niches of most bacterial, archaeal and eukaryotic plankton remain unknown, as well as the interactions between them. Better characterization of these is critical for understanding and predicting ecosystem functioning under anthropogenic pressures. We used environmental DNA metabarcoding across a 6‐year time series to explore the structure and seasonality of pico‐ and nanoplankton communities in two sites of the Bay of Biscay, one coastal and one offshore, and construct association networks to reveal potential keystone and connector taxa. Temporal trends in alpha diversity were similar between the two sites, and concurrent communities more similar than within the same site at different times. However, we found differences between the network topologies of the two sites, with both shared and site‐specific keystones and connectors. For example,
              Micromonas
              , with lower abundance in the offshore site is a keystone here, indicating a stronger effect of associations such as resource competition. This study provides an example of how time series and association network analysis can reveal how similar communities may function differently despite being geographically close.},

            Heterotrophic lineages of stramenopiles exhibit enormous diversity in morphology, lifestyle, and habitat. Among them, the marine stramenopiles (MASTs) represent numerous independent lineages that are only known from environmental sequences retrieved from marine samples. The core energy metabolism characterizing these unicellular eukaryotes is poorly understood. Here, we used single-cell genomics to retrieve, annotate, and compare the genomes of 15 MAST species, obtained by coassembling sequences from 140 individual cells sampled from the marine surface plankton. Functional annotations from their gene repertoires are compatible with all of them being phagocytotic. The unique presence of rhodopsin genes in MAST species, together with their widespread expression in oceanic waters, supports the idea that MASTs may be capable of using sunlight to thrive in the photic ocean. Additional subsets of genes used in phagocytosis, such as proton pumps for vacuole acidification and peptidases for prey digestion, did not reveal particular trends in MAST genomes as compared with nonphagocytotic stramenopiles, except a larger presence and diversity of V-PPase genes. Our analysis reflects the complexity of phagocytosis machinery in microbial eukaryotes, which contrasts with the well-defined set of genes for photosynthesis. These new genomic data provide the essential framework to study ecophysiology of uncultured species and to gain better understanding of the function of rhodopsins and related carotenoids in stramenopiles.},

Here we analyze 58 metagenomes from tropical and subtropical deep oceans to generate the Malaspina Gene Database. Free-living or particle-attached lifestyles drive functional differences in bathypelagic prokaryotic communities, regardless of their biogeography.

The widespread potential to grow both autotrophically and heterotrophically suggests that mixotrophy is an ecologically relevant trait in the deep ocean. These results expand our understanding of the functional microbial structure and metabolic capabilities of the largest Earth aquatic ecosystem.},

Phytoplankton community composition can influence the rate at which heterotrophic microorganisms decompose phytoplankton detrital particles and thus, it controls the fraction of OC that reaches the ocean depths, where it can be sequestered for climate-relevant spans of time. Here, we compared the degradation dynamics of POM from phytoplankton assemblages of contrasting diatom dominance in the presence of mesopelagic prokaryotic communities during a 19-day degradation experiment. We found that diatom-derived POM exhibited an exponential decay rate approximately three times lower than that derived from a community dominated by flagellated phytoplankton (mainly coccolithophores and nanoflagellates). Additionally, dissolved organic matter (DOM) released during the degradation of diatom particles accumulated over the experiment, whereas only residual increases in DOM were detected during the degradation of non-diatom materials. These results suggest that diatom-dominance enhances the efficiencies of the biological carbon pump and microbial carbon pump through the relatively reduced labilities of diatom particles and of the dissolved materials that arise from their microbial processing.},

            Different factors affect the way dissolved organic matter (DOM) is processed in the ocean water column, including environmental conditions and the functional capabilities of the communities. Recent studies have shown that bathypelagic prokaryotes are metabolically flexible, but whether this versatility translates into a higher ability to process DOM has been barely explored. Here we performed a multifactorial transplant experiment to compare the growth, activity and changes in DOM quality in surface and bathypelagic waters inoculated with either surface or bathypelagic prokaryotic communities. The effect of nutrient additions to surface waters was also explored. Despite no differences in the cell abundance of surface and deep ocean prokaryotes were observed in any of the treatments, in surface waters with nutrients the heterotrophic production of surface prokaryotes rapidly decreased. Conversely, bathypelagic communities displayed a sustained production throughout the experiment. Incubations with surface prokaryotes always led to a significant accumulation of recalcitrant compounds, which did not occur with bathypelagic prokaryotes, suggesting they have a higher ability to process DOM. These contrasting abilities could be explained by the recruitment of a comparatively larger number of opportunistic taxa within the bathypelagic assemblages, which likely resulted in a broader community capability of substrate utilization.},

Conversely, wind speed and/or UV radiation could adversely affect virus infection. Furthermore, in polar regions, organic and inorganic nutrient inputs from melting ice may increase microbial activity in the SML. Since the role of viruses in the microbial food web of the SML is poorly understood in polar oceans, we aimed to study the impact of viruses on prokaryotic communities in the SML and in the SSW in Arctic and Antarctic waters. We hypothesized that a higher viral activity in the SML than in the SSW in both polar systems would be observed. We measured viral and prokaryote abundances, virus-mediated mortality on prokaryotes, heterotrophic and phototrophic nanoflagellate abundance, and environmental factors. In both polar zones, we found small differences in environmental factors between the SML and the SSW. In contrast, despite the adverse effect of wind, viral and prokaryote abundances and virus-mediated mortality on prokaryotes were higher in the SML than in the SSW. As a consequence, the higher carbon flux released by lysed cells in the SML than in the SSW would increase the pool of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and be rapidly used by other prokaryotes to grow (the viral shunt). Thus, our results suggest that viral activity greatly contributes to the functioning of the microbial food web in the SML, which could influence the biogeochemical cycles of the water column.},

            The Mediterranean Sea is a miniature ocean divided by the Sicily Strait into two basins with a marked west to east trophic gradient and separated of the nearby eastern Atlantic Ocean by the Strait of Gibraltar. Here, we test the hypothesis that these physical and environmental barriers favor the development of specific prokaryotic assemblages, leading to changes in community structure both in the vertical and horizontal spatial scales. By analyzing taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity using amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) of the 16S rRNA gene, we show that there is indeed marked vertical segregation of prokaryotic groups, similar to that found in other areas of the ocean, but also a clear horizontal structuring among the two Mediterranean basins and the adjacent Atlantic waters. Prokaryotic diversity increased with depth and toward the Atlantic, whereas the easternmost stations displayed more phylogenetically diverse phylotypes, despite harboring globally less diverse communities. Basin‐indicator taxa (ASVs) accounted for a large fraction of the community (between 50\% and 80\%) in each of the basins at the surface and bathypelagic layers, being associated with different environmental variables. The existence of biogeographic and environmental barriers in the Mediterranean Sea is likely related to the trophic gradient at the surface and the isolation of water bodies in depth due to the Gibraltar and Sicily straits. Our work highlights the importance of studying microbial regional biogeography and provides the basis for future studies on the impact of this regionalization in the function of Mediterranean Sea prokaryotic communities.},

            Phagocytosis is a fundamental process in marine ecosystems by which prey organisms are consumed and their biomass incorporated in food webs or remineralized. However, studies searching for the genes underlying this key ecological process in free-living phagocytizing protists are still scarce, in part due to the lack of appropriate ecological models. Our reanalysis of recent molecular datasets revealed that the cultured heterotrophic flagellate Cafeteria burkhardae is widespread in the global oceans, which prompted us to design a transcriptomics study with this species, grown with the cultured flavobacterium Dokdonia sp. We compared the gene expression between exponential and stationary phases, which were complemented with three starvation by dilution phases that appeared as intermediate states. We found distinct expression profiles in each condition and identified 2056 differentially expressed genes between exponential and stationary samples. Upregulated genes at the exponential phase were related to DNA duplication, transcription and translational machinery, protein remodeling, respiration and phagocytosis, whereas upregulated genes in the stationary phase were involved in signal transduction, cell adhesion, and lipid metabolism. We identified a few highly expressed phagocytosis genes, like peptidases and proton pumps, which could be used to target this ecologically relevant process in marine ecosystems.},

            Nitrogen fixation has a critical role in marine primary production, yet our understanding of marine nitrogen-fixers (diazotrophs) is hindered by limited observations. Here, we report a quantitative image analysis pipeline combined with mapping of molecular markers for mining {\textgreater}2,000,000 images and {\textgreater}1300 metagenomes from surface, deep chlorophyll maximum and mesopelagic seawater samples across 6 size fractions ({\textless}0.2–2000 μm). We use this approach to characterise the diversity, abundance, biovolume and distribution of symbiotic, colony-forming and particle-associated diazotrophs at a global scale. We show that imaging and PCR-free molecular data are congruent. Sequence reads indicate diazotrophs are detected from the ultrasmall bacterioplankton ({\textless}0.2 μm) to mesoplankton (180–2000 μm) communities, while images predict numerous symbiotic and colony-forming diazotrophs ({\textgreater}20 µm). Using imaging and molecular data, we estimate that polyploidy can substantially affect gene abundances of symbiotic versus colony-forming diazotrophs. Our results support the canonical view that larger diazotrophs ({\textgreater}10 μm) dominate the tropical belts, while unicellular cyanobacterial and non-cyanobacterial diazotrophs are globally distributed in surface and mesopelagic layers. We describe co-occurring diazotrophic lineages of different lifestyles and identify high-density regions of diazotrophs in the global ocean. Overall, we provide an update of marine diazotroph biogeographical diversity and present a new bioimaging-bioinformatic workflow.},

            East African Great Lakes are old and unique natural resources heavily utilized by their bordering countries. In those lakes, ecosystem functioning is dominated by pelagic processes, where microorganisms are key components; however, protistan diversity is barely known. We investigated the community composition of small eukaryotes (\&lt;10 µm) in surface waters of four African Lakes (Kivu, Edward, Albert and Victoria) by sequencing the 18S rRNA gene. Moreover, in the meromictic Lake Kivu, two stations were vertically studied. We found high protistan diversity distributed in 779 operational taxonomic units (OTUs), spanning in 11 high-rank lineages, being Alveolata (31\%), Opisthokonta (20\%) and Stramenopiles (17\%) the most represented supergroups. Surface protistan assemblages were associated with conductivity and productivity gradients, whereas depth had a strong effect on protistan community in Kivu, with higher contribution of heterotrophic organisms. Approximately 40\% of OTUs had low similarity (\&lt;90\%) with reported sequences in public databases; these were mostly coming from deep anoxic waters of Kivu, suggesting a high extent of novel diversity. We also detected several taxa so far considered exclusive of marine ecosystems. Our results unveiled a complex and largely undescribed protistan community, in which several lineages have adapted to different niches after crossing the salinity boundary.},

            The oceans are populated by an astronomical number of predominantly uncultured microbes, which altogether guarantee ecosystem function. Unicellular eukaryotic predators represent basal links in marine food webs and have so far been predominantly characterized as a functional group, despite having different ecologies and evolutionary histories. In order to better understand the ecoevolution of the ocean’s smallest predators, we have investigated four species belonging to an uncultured cosmopolitan family: marine stramenopiles (MAST)-4. Using state-of-the-art single-cell genomics and metaomics approaches, we found that members of this predatory family have different distributions in the surface ocean and different genes to degrade food, which likely represent niche adaptations. Our work highlights the importance of understanding the species-level ecology and genomics of tiny ocean predators.
          , 
            Unicellular eukaryotic predators play a crucial role in the functioning of the ocean ecosystem by recycling nutrients and energy that are channeled to upper trophic levels. Traditionally, these evolutionarily diverse organisms have been combined into a single functional group (heterotrophic flagellates), overlooking their organismal differences. Here, we investigated four evolutionarily related species belonging to one cosmopolitan group of uncultured marine picoeukaryotic predators: marine stramenopiles (MAST)-4 (species A, B, C, and E). Co-occurrence and distribution analyses in the global surface ocean indicated contrasting patterns in MAST-4A and C, suggesting adaptation to different temperatures. We then investigated whether these spatial distribution patterns were mirrored by MAST-4 genomic content using single-cell genomics. Analyses of 69 single cells recovered 66 to 83\% of the MAST-4A/B/C/E genomes, which displayed substantial interspecies divergence. MAST-4 genomes were similar in terms of broad gene functional categories, but they differed in enzymes of ecological relevance, such as glycoside hydrolases (GHs), which are part of the food degradation machinery in MAST-4. Interestingly, MAST-4 species featuring a similar GH composition (A and C) coexcluded each other in the surface global ocean, while species with a different set of GHs (B and C) appeared to be able to coexist, suggesting further niche diversification associated with prey digestion. We propose that differential niche adaptation to temperature and prey type has promoted adaptive evolutionary diversification in MAST-4. We show that minute ocean predators from the same phylogenetic group may have different biogeography and genomic content, which needs to be accounted for to better comprehend marine food webs.},

            Marine heterotrophic flagellates (HFs) form a diverse and ecologically relevant functional group of bacterial grazers and nutrient remineralizers in oceanic waters. Despite playing a crucial role in marine biogeochemical cycles, there is still a lack of information on which specific taxa dominate HF assemblages and what are their patterns of distribution in a global context. In the present work, we addressed this issue by analyzing amplicon sequencing data sets retrieved from samples taken in tropical and subtropical oceanic regions at depths from surface to 4000 m. Only a few dozens of widespread taxa, mostly affiliating to MAST clades, Picozoa, Bicosoecida and Chrysophyceae, seemed to dominate surface HF assemblages. The majority of these dominant HFs were present at relatively constant abundances, while others were influenced by temperature or displayed a patchy distribution. In the deep ocean, only a handful of taxa belonging to Bicosoecida and Chrysophyceae, together with Diplonemea and Kinetoplastida, explained most of the HF signal. Co‐occurrence networks between HF and prokaryotic taxa at the surface ocean revealed two main clusters influenced by temperature that did not seem to show specific patterns of interaction. However, some correlations emerged outside these thermal groups that could represent new prey–predator interactions. Overall, we identified the putatively most ecologically relevant HF taxa in the ocean, which become promising targets for further experimental and genomic studies.},

              Ostreococcus
              is a cosmopolitan marine genus of phytoplankton found in mesotrophic and oligotrophic waters, and the smallest free‐living eukaryotes known to date, with a cell diameter close to 1 μm.
              Ostreococcus
              has been extensively studied as a model system to investigate viral–host dynamics in culture, yet the impact of viruses in naturally occurring populations is largely unknown. Here, we used Virus Fluorescence
              in situ
              Hybridization (VirusFISH) to visualize and quantify viral‐host dynamics in natural populations of
              Ostreococcus
              during a seasonal cycle in the central Cantabrian Sea (Southern Bay of Biscay).
              Ostreococcus
              were predominantly found during summer and autumn at surface and 50 m depth, in coastal, mid‐shelf and shelf waters, representing up to 21\% of the picoeukaryotic communities. Viral infection was only detected in surface waters, and its impact was variable but highest from May to July and November to December, when up to half of the population was infected. Metatranscriptomic data available from the mid‐shelf station unveiled that the
              Ostreococcus
              population was dominated by the species
              O. lucimarinus

While its aftermath for calcifying microbes has been widely studied, the effect of ocean acidification (OA) on marine viruses and their microbial hosts is controversial, and even more in combination with another anthropogenic stressor, i.e., human-induced nutrient loads. In this study, two mesocosm acidification experiments with Mediterranean waters from different seasons revealed distinct effects of OA on viruses and viral-mediated prokaryotic mortality depending on the trophic state and the successional stage of the plankton community. In the winter bloom situation, low fluorescence viruses, the most abundant virus-like particle (VLP) subpopulation comprising mostly bacteriophages, were negatively affected by lowered pH with nutrient addition, while the bacterial host abundance was stimulated. High fluorescence viruses, containing cyanophages, were stimulated by OA regardless of the nutrient conditions, while cyanobacteria of the genus
              Synechococcus
              were negatively affected by OA. Moreover, the abundance of very high fluorescence viruses infecting small haptophytes tended to be lower under acidification while their putative hosts' abundance was enhanced, suggesting a direct and negative effect of OA on viral–host interactions. In the oligotrophic summer situation, we found a stimulating effect of OA on total viral abundance and the viral populations, suggesting a cascading effect of the elevated
              p
              CO
              2
              stimulating autotrophic and heterotrophic production. In winter, viral lysis accounted for 30 ± 16\% of the loss of bacterial standing stock per day (VMM

              compared to 53 ± 35\% in the control treatments, without effects of nutrient additions while in summer, OA had no significant effects on VMM
              BSS
              (35 ± 20\% and 38 ± 5\% per day in the OA and control treatments, respectively). We found that phage production and resulting organic carbon release rates significantly reduced under OA in the nutrient replete winter situation, but it was also observed that high nutrient loads lowered the negative effect of OA on viral lysis, suggesting an antagonistic interplay between these two major global ocean stressors in the Anthropocene. In summer, however, viral-mediated carbon release rates were lower and not affected by lowered pH. Eutrophication consistently stimulated viral production regardless of the season or initial conditions. Given the relevant role of viruses for marine carbon cycling and the biological carbon pump, these two anthropogenic stressors may modulate carbon fluxes through their effect on viruses at the base of the pelagic food web in a future global change scenario.},

            Surveying microbial diversity and function is accomplished by combining complementary molecular tools. Among them, metagenomics is a PCR free approach that contains all genetic information from microbial assemblages and is today performed at a relatively large scale and reasonable cost, mostly based on very short reads. Here, we investigated the potential of metagenomics to provide taxonomic reports of marine microbial eukaryotes. We prepared a curated database with reference sequences of the V4 region of 18S rDNA clustered at 97\% similarity and used this database to extract and classify metagenomic reads. More than half of them were unambiguously affiliated to a unique reference whilst the rest could be assigned to a given taxonomic group. The overall diversity reported by metagenomics was similar to that obtained by amplicon sequencing of the V4 and V9 regions of the 18S rRNA gene, although either one or both of these amplicon surveys performed poorly for groups like Excavata, Amoebozoa, Fungi and Haptophyta. We then studied the diversity of picoeukaryotes and nanoeukaryotes using 91 metagenomes from surface down to bathypelagic layers in different oceans, unveiling a clear taxonomic separation between size fractions and depth layers. Finally, we retrieved long rDNA sequences from assembled metagenomes that improved phylogenetic reconstructions of particular groups. Overall, this study shows metagenomics as an excellent resource for taxonomic exploration of marine microbial eukaryotes.},

Viral communities determined by randomly amplified polymorphic DNA–polymerase chain reaction (RAPD-PCR) were grouped according to the sampling location, being more similar within them than among regions. The first two axes of a canonical correspondence analysis, including physicochemical (temperature, salinity, inorganic nutrients—NO3−, SiO42−, and dimethyl sulfoniopropionate -DMSP- and isoprene concentrations) and microbiological (chlorophyll a, haptophytes and diatom, and prokaryote abundance and prokaryotic heterotrophic production) factors accounted for 62.9\% of the variance. The first axis, temperature-related, accounted for 33.8\%; the second one, salinity-related, accounted for 29.1\%.

            Ciliates are globally distributed eukaryotic organisms inhabiting virtually all environments on Earth. Although ciliates range from 10 µm to a few millimetres in cell size, they are repeatedly reported in the pico‐sized fraction ({\textless}2–3 µm) of molecular surveys. Here, we used existing data sets (BioMarKs and Tara Oceans) with different size fractions to demonstrate that the ciliate pico‐sized signal, probably derived from cell breakage during filtration, is informative and reliable to study marine ciliate biodiversity and biogeography. We then used sequences from the pico‐eukaryotic fraction of two circumnavigation expeditions, Malaspina‐2010 and Tara Oceans, to give insights into the taxonomic composition and horizontal and vertical distribution of ciliates in the global ocean. The results suggested a high homogeneity of ciliate communities along the ocean surface from temperate to tropical waters, with ciliate assemblages dominated by a few abundant and widely distributed taxa. Very few taxa were found in a single oceanic region, therefore suggesting a high level of ciliate cosmopolitanism in the global ocean. In vertical profiles, ciliates were detected up to 4,000 m depth, and a clear vertical community structuring was observed. Our results provided evidence supporting ciliates as deeply integrated organisms in the deep‐sea trophic web, where they may play a relevant role as symbionts of metazoans and grazers of prokaryotes and small eukaryotes in the water column and in aggregates.},

                The ocean microbiota modulates global biogeochemical cycles and changes in its configuration may have large-scale consequences. Yet, the underlying ecological mechanisms structuring it are unclear. Here, we investigate how fundamental ecological mechanisms (

                and
                ecological drift
                ) shape the smallest members of the tropical and subtropical surface-ocean microbiota: prokaryotes and minute eukaryotes (picoeukaryotes). Furthermore, we investigate the agents exerting abiotic selection on this assemblage as well as the spatial patterns emerging from the action of ecological mechanisms. To explore this, we analysed the composition of surface-ocean prokaryotic and picoeukaryotic communities using DNA-sequence data (16S- and 18S-rRNA genes) collected during the circumglobal expeditions

              Results
              
                We found that the two main components of the tropical and subtropical surface-ocean microbiota, prokaryotes and picoeukaryotes, appear to be structured by different ecological mechanisms. Picoeukaryotic communities were predominantly structured by dispersal-limitation, while prokaryotic counterparts appeared to be shaped by the combined action of dispersal-limitation, selection and drift. Temperature-driven selection appeared as a major factor, out of a few selected factors, influencing species co-occurrence networks in prokaryotes but not in picoeukaryotes, indicating that association patterns may contribute to understand ocean microbiota structure and response to selection. Other measured abiotic variables seemed to have limited selective effects on community structure in the tropical and subtropical ocean. Picoeukaryotes displayed a higher spatial differentiation between communities and a higher distance decay when compared to prokaryotes, consistent with a scenario of higher dispersal limitation in the former after considering environmental heterogeneity. Lastly, random dynamics or
                drift
                seemed to have a more important role in structuring prokaryotic communities than picoeukaryotic counterparts.
              
            
            
              Conclusions
              The differential action of ecological mechanisms seems to cause contrasting biogeography, in the tropical and subtropical ocean, among the smallest surface plankton, prokaryotes and picoeukaryotes. This suggests that the idiosyncrasy of the main constituents of the ocean microbiota should be considered in order to understand its current and future configuration, which is especially relevant in a context of global change, where the reaction of surface ocean plankton to temperature increase is still unclear.},

In the remote oceans, where secondary aerosols are mostly biogenic, marine isoprene emissions affect atmospheric chemistry and influence cloud formation and brightness. Here, we present the first compilation of new and published measurements of isoprene concentrations in the Southern Ocean and explore their distribution patterns. Surface ocean isoprene concentrations in November through April span 1 to 94 pM. A band of higher concentrations is observed around a latitude of ≈40     ∘     S and a surface sea temperature of 15      ∘    C. High isoprene also occurs in high productivity waters near islands and continental coasts. We use concurrent measurements of physical, chemical, and biological variables to explore the main potential drivers of isoprene concentration by means of paired regressions and multivariate analysis. Isoprene is best explained by phytoplankton-related variables like the concentrations of chlorophyll-a, photoprotective pigments and particulate organic matter, photosynthetic efficiency (influenced by iron availability), and the chlorophyll-a shares of most phytoplankton groups, and not by macronutrients or bacterial abundance. A simple statistical model based on chlorophyll-a concentration and a sea surface temperature discontinuity accounts for half of the variance of isoprene concentrations in surface waters of the Southern Ocean.},

              Background
              Isolation of marine microorganisms is fundamental to gather information about their physiology, ecology and genomic content. To date, most of the bacterial isolation efforts have focused on the photic ocean leaving the deep ocean less explored. We have created a marine culture collection of heterotrophic bacteria (MARINHET) using a standard marine medium comprising a total of 1561 bacterial strains, and covering a variety of oceanographic regions from different seasons and years, from 2009 to 2015. Specifically, our marine collection contains isolates from both photic (817) and aphotic layers (744), including the mesopelagic (362) and the bathypelagic (382), from the North Western Mediterranean Sea, the North and South Atlantic Ocean, the Indian, the Pacific, and the Arctic Oceans. We described the taxonomy, the phylogenetic diversity and the biogeography of a fraction of the marine culturable microorganisms to enhance our knowledge about which heterotrophic marine isolates are recurrently retrieved across oceans and along different depths.
            
            
              Results
              
                The partial sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene of all isolates revealed that they mainly affiliate with the classes
                Alphaproteobacteria
                (35.9\%),
                Gammaproteobacteria
                (38.6\%), and phylum
                Bacteroidetes
                (16.5\%). In addition,
                Alteromonas
                and
                Erythrobacter
                genera were found the most common heterotrophic bacteria in the ocean growing in solid agar medium. When comparing all photic, mesopelagic, and bathypelagic isolates sequences retrieved from different stations, 37\% of them were 100\% identical. This percentage increased up to 59\% when mesopelagic and bathypelagic strains were grouped as the aphotic dataset and compared to the photic dataset of isolates, indicating the ubiquity of some bacterial isolates along different ocean depths. Finally, we isolated three strains that represent a new species, and the genome comparison and phenotypic characterization of two of these strains (ISS653 and ISS1889) concluded that they belong to a new species within the genus
                Mesonia

            Environmental molecular sequencing has revealed an abundance of microorganisms that were previously unknown, mainly because most had not been cultured in the laboratory. Within this novel diversity, there are the uncultured MAST clades (MArine STramenopiles), which are major components of marine heterotrophic flagellates (HFs) thought to be active bacterial grazers. In this study, we investigated the gene expression of natural HFs in a mixed community where bacterivory was promoted. Using fluorescence in situ hybridization and 18S rDNA derived from metatranscriptomics, we followed the taxonomic dynamics during the incubation, and confirmed the increase in relative abundance of different MAST lineages. We then used single cell genomes of several MAST species to gain an insight into their most expressed genes, with a particular focus on genes related to phagocytosis. The genomes of MAST‐4A and MAST‐4B were the most represented in the metatranscriptomes, and we identified highly expressed genes of these two species involved in motility and cytoskeleton remodeling, as well as many lysosomal enzymes. Particularly relevant were the cathepsins, which are characteristic digestive enzymes of the phagolysosome and the rhodopsins, perhaps used for vacuole acidification. The combination of single cell genomics and metatranscriptomics gives insights on the phagocytic capacity of uncultured and ecologically relevant HF species.},

            Microbial communities are essential components of aquatic ecosystems through their contribution to food web dynamics and biogeochemical processes. Aquatic microbial diversity is immense and a general challenge is to understand how metabolism and interactions of single organisms shape microbial community dynamics and ecosystem‐scale biogeochemical transformations. Metagenomic approaches have developed rapidly, and proven to be powerful in linking microbial community dynamics to biogeochemical processes. In this review, we provide an overview of metagenomic approaches, followed by a discussion on some recent insights they have provided, including those in this special issue. These include the discovery of new taxa and metabolisms in aquatic microbiomes, insights into community assembly and functional ecology as well as evolutionary processes shaping microbial genomes and microbiomes, and the influence of human activities on aquatic microbiomes. Given that metagenomics can now be considered a mature technology where data generation and descriptive analyses are relatively routine and informative, we then discuss metagenomic‐enabled research avenues to further link microbial dynamics to biogeochemical processes. These include the integration of metagenomics into well‐designed ecological experiments, the use of metagenomics to inform and validate metabolic and biogeochemical models, and the pressing need for ecologically relevant model organisms and simple microbial systems to better interpret the taxonomic and functional information integrated in metagenomes. These research avenues will contribute to a more mechanistic and predictive understanding of links between microbial dynamics and biogeochemical cycles. Owing to rapid climate change and human impacts on aquatic ecosystems, the urgency of such an understanding has never been greater.},

            Deep ocean microbial communities rely on the organic carbon produced in the sunlit ocean, yet it remains unknown whether surface processes determine the assembly and function of bathypelagic prokaryotes to a larger extent than deep‐sea physicochemical conditions. Here, we explored whether variations in surface phytoplankton assemblages across Atlantic, Pacific and Indian ocean stations can explain structural changes in bathypelagic (ca. 4,000 m) free‐living and particle‐attached prokaryotic communities (characterized through 16S rRNA gene sequencing), as well as changes in prokaryotic activity and dissolved organic matter (DOM) quality. We show that the spatial structuring of prokaryotic communities in the bathypelagic strongly followed variations in the abundances of surface dinoflagellates and ciliates, as well as gradients in surface primary productivity, but were less influenced by bathypelagic physicochemical conditions. Amino acid‐like DOM components in the bathypelagic reflected variations of those components in surface waters, and seemed to control bathypelagic prokaryotic activity. The imprint of surface conditions was more evident in bathypelagic than in shallower mesopelagic (200–1,000 m) communities, suggesting a direct connectivity through fast‐sinking particles that escape mesopelagic transformations. Finally, we identified a pool of endemic deep‐sea prokaryotic taxa (including potentially chemoautotrophic groups) that appear less connected to surface processes than those bathypelagic taxa with a widespread vertical distribution. Our results suggest that surface planktonic communities shape the spatial structure of the bathypelagic microbiome to a larger extent than the local physicochemical environment, likely through determining the nature of the sinking particles and the associated prokaryotes reaching bathypelagic waters.},

            Microbial eukaryotes are key components of the ocean plankton. Yet, our understanding of their community composition and activity in different water layers of the ocean is limited, particularly for picoeukaryotes (0.2–3 µm cell size). Here, we examined the picoeukaryotic communities inhabiting different vertical zones of the tropical and subtropical global ocean: surface, deep chlorophyll maximum, mesopelagic (including the deep scattering layer and oxygen minimum zones), and bathypelagic. Communities were analysed by high-tthroughput sequencing of the 18S rRNA gene (V4 region) as represented by DNA (community structure) and RNA (metabolism), followed by delineation of Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) at 99\% similarity. We found a stratification of the picoeukaryotic communities along the water column, with assemblages corresponding to the sunlit and dark ocean. Specific taxonomic groups either increased (e.g., Chrysophyceae or Bicosoecida) or decreased (e.g., Dinoflagellata or MAST-3) in abundance with depth. We used the rRNA:rDNA ratio of each OTU as a proxy of metabolic activity. The highest relative activity was found in the mesopelagic layer for most taxonomic groups, and the lowest in the bathypelagic. Altogether, we characterize the change in community structure and metabolic activity of picoeukaryotes with depth in the global ocean, suggesting a hotspot of activity in the mesopelagic.},

            The assembly of single-amplified genomes (SAGs) and metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) has led to a surge in genome-based discoveries of members affiliated with Archaea and Bacteria, bringing with it a need to develop guidelines for nomenclature of uncultivated microorganisms. The International Code of Nomenclature of Prokaryotes (ICNP) only recognizes cultures as ‘type material’, thereby preventing the naming of uncultivated organisms. In this Consensus Statement, we propose two potential paths to solve this nomenclatural conundrum. One option is the adoption of previously proposed modifications to the ICNP to recognize DNA sequences as acceptable type material; the other option creates a nomenclatural code for uncultivated Archaea and Bacteria that could eventually be merged with the ICNP in the future. Regardless of the path taken, we believe that action is needed now within the scientific community to develop consistent rules for nomenclature of uncultivated taxa in order to provide clarity and stability, and to effectively communicate microbial diversity.},

              Estimation of prokaryotic growth rates is critical to understand the ecological role and contribution of different microbes to marine biogeochemical cycles. However, there is a general lack of knowledge on what factors control the growth rates of different prokaryotic groups and how these vary between sites and along seasons at a given site. We carried out several manipulation experiments during the four astronomical seasons in the coastal NW Mediterranean in order to evaluate the impact of grazing, viral mortality, resource competition and light on the growth and loss rates of prokaryotes. Gross and net growth rates of different bacterioplankton groups targeted by group-specific CARD-FISH probes and infrared microscopy (for aerobic anoxygenic phototrophs, AAP), were calculated from changes in cell abundances. Maximal group-specific growth rates were achieved when both predation pressure and nutrient limitation were experimentally minimized, while only a minimal effect of viral pressure on growth rates was observed; nevertheless, the response to predation removal was more remarkable in winter, when the bacterial community was not subjected to nutrient limitation. Although all groups showed increases in their growth rates when resource competition as well as grazers and viral pressure were reduced,
              Alteromonadaceae
              consistently presented the highest rates in all seasons. The response to light availability was generally weaker than that to the other factors, but it was variable between seasons. In summer and spring, the growth rates of AAP were stimulated by light whereas the growth of the SAR11 clade (likely containing proteorhodopsin) was enhanced by light in all seasons. Overall, our results set thresholds on bacterioplankton group-specific growth and mortality rates and contribute to estimate the seasonally changing contribution of various bacterioplankton groups to the function of microbial communities. Our results also indicate that the least abundant groups display the highest growth rates, contributing to the recycling of organic matter to a much greater extent than what their abundances alone would predict.},

              Viruses are the most abundant biological entities on Earth and have fundamental ecological roles in controlling microbial communities. Yet, although their diversity is being increasingly explored, little is known about the extent of viral interactions with their protist hosts as most studies are limited to a few cultivated species. Here, we exploit the potential of single‐cell genomics to unveil viral associations in 65 individual cells of 11 essentially uncultured stramenopiles lineages sampled during the
              Tara
              Oceans expedition. We identified viral signals in 57\% of the cells, covering nearly every lineage and with narrow host specificity signal. Only seven out of the 64 detected viruses displayed homologies to known viral sequences. A search for our viral sequences in global ocean metagenomes showed that they were preferentially found at the DCM and within the 0.2–3 µm size fraction. Some of the viral signals were widely distributed, while others geographically constrained. Among the viral signals we detected an endogenous mavirus virophage potentially integrated within the nuclear genome of two distant uncultured stramenopiles. Virophages have been previously reported as a cell's defence mechanism against other viruses, and may therefore play an important ecological role in regulating protist populations. Our results point to single‐cell genomics as a powerful tool to investigate viral associations in uncultured protists, suggesting a wide distribution of these relationships, and providing new insights into the global viral diversity.},

              Predicting responses of plankton to variations in essential nutrients is hampered by limited in situ measurements, a poor understanding of community composition, and the lack of reference gene catalogs for key taxa. Iron is a key driver of plankton dynamics and, therefore, of global biogeochemical cycles and climate. To assess the impact of iron availability on plankton communities, we explored the comprehensive bio‐oceanographic and bio‐omics data sets from
              Tara
              Oceans in the context of the iron products from two state‐of‐the‐art global scale biogeochemical models. We obtained novel information about adaptation and acclimation toward iron in a range of phytoplankton, including picocyanobacteria and diatoms, and identified whole subcommunities covarying with iron. Many of the observed global patterns were recapitulated in the Marquesas archipelago, where frequent plankton blooms are believed to be caused by natural iron fertilization, although they are not captured in large‐scale biogeochemical models. This work provides a proof of concept that integrative analyses, spanning from genes to ecosystems and viruses to zooplankton, can disentangle the complexity of plankton communities and can lead to more accurate formulations of resource bioavailability in biogeochemical models, thus improving our understanding of plankton resilience in a changing environment.

            Plain Language Summary
            
              Marine phytoplankton require iron for their growth and proliferation. According to John Martin's iron hypothesis, fertilizing the ocean with iron could dramatically increase photosynthetic activity, thus representing a biological means to counteract global warming. However, while there is a constantly growing knowledge of how iron is distributed in the ocean and about its role in cellular processes in marine photosynthetic groups such as diatoms and cyanobacteria, less is known about how iron availability shapes plankton communities and how they respond to it. In the present work, we exploited recently published
              Tara
              Oceans data sets to address these questions. We first defined specific subcommunities of co‐occurring organisms that co‐vary with iron availability in the oceans. We then identified specific patterns of adaptation and acclimation to iron in different groups of phytoplankton. Finally, we validated our global results at local scale, specifically in the Marquesas archipelago, where recurrent phytoplankton blooms are believed to be a result of iron fertilization. By integrating global data with a localized response, we provide a framework for understanding the resilience of plankton ecosystems in a changing environment.

              Bacteroidetes is one of the dominant phyla of ocean bacterioplankton, yet its diversity and population structure is poorly understood. To advance in the delineation of ecologically meaningful units within this group, we constructed near full‐length 16S rRNA gene clone libraries from contrasting marine environments in the NW Mediterranean. Based on phylogeny and the associated ecological variables (depth and season), 24 different Bacteroidetes clades were delineated. By considering their relative abundance (from iTag amplicon sequencing studies), we described the distribution patterns of each of these clades, delimiting them as Ecologically Significant Taxonomic Units (ESTUs). Spatially, there was almost no overlap among ESTUs at different depths. In deep waters there was predominance of
              Owenweeksia, Leeuwenhoekiella
              ,
              Muricauda
              ‐related genera, and some depth‐associated ESTUs within the NS5 and NS2b marine clades. Seasonally, multi‐annual dynamics of recurring ESTUs were present with dominance of some ESTUs within the NS4, NS5 and NS2b marine clades along most of the year, but with variable relative frequencies between months. A drastic change towards the predominance of
              Formosa
              ‐related ESTUs and one ESTU from the NS5 marine clade was typically present after the spring bloom. Even though there are no isolates available for these ESTUs to determine their physiology, correlation analyses identified the environmental preference of some of them. Overall, our results suggest that there is a high degree of niche specialisation within these closely related clades. This work constitutes a step forward in disentangling the ecology of marine Bacteroidetes, which are essential players in organic matter processing in the oceans.},

            Microbial taxa range from being ubiquitous and abundant across space to extremely rare and endemic, depending on their ecophysiology and on different processes acting locally or regionally. However, little is known about how cosmopolitan or rare taxa combine to constitute communities and whether environmental variations promote changes in their relative abundances. Here we identified the Spatial Abundance Distribution (SpAD) of individual prokaryotic taxa (16S rDNA‐defined Operational Taxonomic Units, OTUs) across 108 globally‐distributed surface ocean stations. We grouped taxa based on their SpAD shape (“normal‐like”‐ abundant and ubiquitous; “logistic”‐ globally rare, present in few sites; and “bimodal”‐ abundant only in certain oceanic regions), and investigated how the abundance of these three categories relates to environmental gradients. Most surface assemblages were numerically dominated by a few cosmopolitan “normal‐like” OTUs, yet there was a gradual shift towards assemblages dominated by “logistic” taxa in specific areas with productivity and temperature differing the most from the average conditions in the sampled stations. When we performed the SpAD categorization including additional habitats (deeper layers and particles of varying sizes), the SpAD of many OTUs changed towards fewer “normal‐like” shapes, and OTUs categorized as globally rare in the surface ocean became abundant. This suggests that understanding the mechanisms behind microbial rarity and dominance requires expanding the context of study beyond local communities and single habitats. We show that marine bacterial communities comprise taxa displaying a continuum of SpADs, and that variations in their abundances can be linked to habitat transitions or barriers that delimit the distribution of community members.},

            We studied the long-term temporal dynamics of the aerobic anoxygenic phototrophic (AAP) bacteria, a relevant functional group in the coastal marine microbial food web, using high-throughput sequencing of the pufM gene coupled with multivariate, time series and co-occurrence analyses at the Blanes Bay Microbial Observatory (NW Mediterranean). Additionally, using metagenomics, we tested whether the used primers captured accurately the seasonality of the most relevant AAP groups. Phylogroup K (Gammaproteobacteria) was the greatest contributor to community structure over all seasons, with phylogroups E and G (Alphaproteobacteria) being prevalent in spring. Diversity indices showed a clear seasonal trend, with maximum values in winter, which was inverse to that of AAP abundance. Multivariate analyses revealed sample clustering by season, with a relevant proportion of the variance explained by day length, temperature, salinity, phototrophic nanoflagellate abundance, chlorophyll a, and silicate concentration. Time series analysis showed robust rhythmic patterns of co-occurrence, but distinct seasonal behaviors within the same phylogroup, and even within different amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) conforming the same operational taxonomic unit (OTU). Altogether, our results picture the AAP assemblage as highly seasonal and recurrent but containing ecotypes showing distinctive temporal niche partitioning, rather than being a cohesive functional group.},

	abstract = {Abstract. Transparent exopolymer particles (TEPs) are a class of gel
particles, produced mainly by microorganisms, which play important roles in
biogeochemical processes such as carbon cycling and export. TEPs (a) are
colonized by carbon-consuming microbes; (b) mediate aggregation and sinking
of organic matter and organisms, thereby contributing to the biological
carbon pump; and (c) accumulate in the surface microlayer (SML) and affect
air–sea gas exchange. The first step to evaluate the global influence of
TEPs in these processes is the prediction of TEP occurrence in the ocean.
Yet, little is known about the physical and biological variables that drive
their abundance, particularly in the open ocean. Here we describe the
horizontal TEP distribution, along with physical and biological variables, in
surface waters along a north–south transect in the Atlantic Ocean during
October–November 2014. Two main regions were separated due to remarkable
differences: the open Atlantic Ocean (OAO, n=30), and the Southwestern
Atlantic Shelf (SWAS, n=10). TEP concentration in the entire transect
ranged 18.3–446.8 µg XG eq L−1 and averaged 117.1±119.8 µg XG eq L−1, with the maximum concentrations in the
SWAS and in a station located at the edge of the Canary Coastal Upwelling
(CU), and the highest TEP to chlorophyll a (TEP:Chl a)
ratios in the OAO (183±56) and CU (1760). TEPs were significantly and
positively related to Chl a and phytoplankton biomass, expressed in terms
of C, along the entire transect. In the OAO, TEPs were positively related to
some phytoplankton groups, mainly Synechococcus. They were
negatively related to the previous 24 h averaged solar irradiance,
suggesting that sunlight, particularly UV radiation, is more a sink than a
source for TEP. Multiple regression analyses showed the combined positive
effect of phytoplankton and heterotrophic prokaryotes (HPs) on TEP
distribution in the OAO. In the SWAS, TEPs were positively related to high
nucleic acid-containing prokaryotic cells and total phytoplankton biomass,
but not to any particular phytoplankton group. Estimated TEP–carbon
constituted an important portion of the particulate organic carbon pool in
the entire transect (28 \%–110 \%), generally higher than the
phytoplankton and HP carbon shares, which highlights the importance of TEPs
in the cycling of organic matter in the ocean.},

            How much temporal recurrence is present in microbial assemblages is still an unanswered ecological question. Even though marked seasonal changes have been reported for whole microbial communities, less is known on the dynamics and seasonality of individual taxa. Here, we aim at understanding microbial recurrence at three different levels: community, taxonomic group and operational taxonomic units (OTUs). For that, we focused on a model microbial eukaryotic community populating a long‐term marine microbial observatory using 18S rRNA gene data from two organismal size fractions: the picoplankton (0.2–3 µm) and the nanoplankton (3–20 µm). We have developed an index to quantify recurrence in particular taxa. We found that community structure oscillated systematically between two main configurations corresponding to winter and summer over the 10 years studied. A few taxonomic groups such as Mamiellophyceae or MALV‐III presented clear recurrence (i.e., seasonality), whereas 13\%–19\% of the OTUs in both size fractions, accounting for {\textasciitilde}40\% of the relative abundance, featured recurrent dynamics. Altogether, our work links long‐term whole community dynamics with that of individual OTUs and taxonomic groups, indicating that recurrent and non‐recurrent changes characterize the dynamics of microbial assemblages.

              . 59(5)] and retains an emphasis on protists. Changes since have improved the resolution of many nodes in phylogenetic analyses. For some clades even families are being clearly resolved. As we had predicted, environmental sampling in the intervening years has massively increased the genetic information at hand. Consequently, we have discovered novel clades, exciting new genera and uncovered a massive species level diversity beyond the morphological species descriptions. Several clades known from environmental samples only have now found their home. Sampling soils, deeper marine waters and the deep sea will continue to fill us with surprises. The main changes in this revision are the confirmation that eukaryotes form at least two domains, the loss of monophyly in the Excavata, robust support for the Haptista and Cryptista. We provide suggested primer sets for DNA sequences from environmental samples that are effective for each clade. We have provided a guide to trophic functional guilds in an appendix, to facilitate the interpretation of environmental samples, and a standardized taxonomic guide for East Asian users.},

              Marine planktonic protists are critical components of ocean ecosystems and are highly diverse. Molecular sequencing methods are being used to describe this diversity and reveal new associations and metabolisms that are important to how these ecosystems function. We describe here the use of the single cell genomics approach to sample and interrogate the diversity of the smaller (pico- and nano-sized) protists from a range of oceanic samples. We created over 900 single amplified genomes (SAGs) from 8
              Tara
              Ocean samples across the Indian Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea. We show that flow cytometric sorting of single cells effectively distinguishes plastidic and aplastidic cell types that agree with our understanding of protist phylogeny. Yields of genomic DNA with PCR-identifiable 18S rRNA gene sequence from single cells was low (15\% of aplastidic cell sorts, and 7\% of plastidic sorts) and tests with alternate primers and comparisons to metabarcoding did not reveal phylogenetic bias in the major protist groups. There was little evidence of significant bias against or in favor of any phylogenetic group expected or known to be present. The four open ocean stations in the Indian Ocean had similar communities, despite ranging from 14°N to 20°S latitude, and they differed from the Mediterranean station. Single cell genomics of protists suggests that the taxonomic diversity of the dominant taxa found in only several hundreds of microliters of surface seawater is similar to that found in molecular surveys where liters of sample are filtered.},

              2
              )‐fixing cyanobacteria in the ocean. Although it remains uncultivated, multiple sublineages have been detected based on partial nitrogenase (
              nifH
              ) gene sequences, including the four most commonly detected sublineages UCYN‐A1, UCYN‐A2, UCYN‐A3 and UCYN‐A4. However, very little is known about UCYN‐A3 beyond the
              nifH
              sequences from
              nifH
              gene diversity surveys. In this study, single cell sorting, DNA sequencing, qPCR and CARD‐FISH assays revealed discrepancies involving the identification of sublineages, which led to new information on the diversity of the UCYN‐A symbiosis. 16S rRNA and
              nifH
              gene sequencing on single sorted cells allowed us to identify the 16S rRNA gene of the uncharacterized UCYN‐A3 sublineage. We designed new CARD‐FISH probes that allowed us to distinguish and observe UCYN‐A2 in a coastal location (SIO Pier; San Diego) and UCYN‐A3 in an open ocean location (Station ALOHA; Hawaii). Moreover, we reconstructed about 13\% of the UCYN‐A3 genome from
              Tara
              Oceans metagenomic data. Finally, our findings unveil the UCYN‐A3 symbiosis in open ocean waters suggesting that the different UCYN‐A sublineages are distributed along different size fractions of the plankton defined by the cell‐size ranges of their prymnesiophyte hosts.},

            Determining the factors that influence marine microbial growth and community structure are critical for the understanding of global carbon cycling. Since the early twentieth century, it has been known that B vitamins play an important role in phytoplankton community dynamics. Limited oceanic dissolved B vitamin distributions indicate that these important coenzymes are present at picomolar levels, which could be too low to support maximal phytoplankton growth, and vast regions of the ocean exist where they are undetectable. Despite their importance, particulate B vitamin concentrations of field microbial populations are unknown. Here we report B vitamin concentrations measured in both the particulate and dissolved fractions, including multiple biochemically relevant B vitamin congeners. We establish their spatial distributions spanning distinct biogeographic and oceanographic regimes in the Mediterranean Sea and the Eastern Atlantic Ocean and show that all congeners are present both dissolved in seawater and in suspended particles. We observe that B vitamins cooccur in patches defined by regional biogeographic and oceanographic features. Additionally, distinct patterns of congener relative abundance in the dissolved and particulate pools provide insight to biological and chemical cycling of these compounds between and within the dissolved and particulate pools. Finally, linear model results demonstrate that model fits of microbial assemblages are strongest when they include both inorganic nutrients and dissolved B vitamin concentrations. We believe that these findings represent an advance in our understanding of B vitamin oceanographic distributions and point to interesting hypotheses of their influence on marine microbial ecology.

              Protists have fundamental ecological roles in marine environments and their diversity is being increasingly explored, yet little is known about the quantitative importance of specific taxa in these ecosystems. Here we optimized a newly developed automated system of image acquisition and image analysis to enumerate minute uncultured cells of different sizes targeted by fluorescence
              in situ
              hybridization. The automated counting routine was highly reproducible, well correlated with manual counts, and was then applied on surface and deep chlorophyll maximum samples from the Malaspina 2010 circumnavigation. The three targeted uncultured taxa (MAST‐4, MAST‐7 and MAST‐1C) were found in virtually all samples from several ocean basins (Atlantic, Indian and Pacific) in fairly constant cell abundances, following typical lognormal distributions. Their global abundances averaged 49, 23 and 7 cells ml

Our innovative high‐throughput cell counting routine allows for the first time a direct assessment of the biogeographic distribution of small protists ({\textless} 5 μm) and shows the ubiquity in sunlit oceans of three bacterivorous taxa, suggesting their key roles in marine ecosystems.},

            The bathypelagic ocean is one of the largest ecosystems on Earth and sustains half of the ocean's microbial activity. This microbial activity strongly relies on surface‐derived particles, but there is growing evidence that the carbon released through solubilization of these particles may not be sufficient to meet the energy demands of deep ocean prokaryotes. To explore how bathypelagic prokaryotes respond to the absence of external inputs of carbon, we followed the long‐term (1 year) dynamics of an enclosed community. Despite the lack of external energy supply, we observed a continuous succession of active prokaryotic phylotypes, which was driven by recruitment of taxa from the seed bank (i.e., initially rare operational taxonomic units [OTUs]). A single OTU belonging to Marine Group I of Thaumarchaeota, which was originally rare, dominated the microbial community for ∼ 4 months and played a fundamental role in this succession likely by introducing new organic carbon through chemolithoautotrophy. This carbon presumably produced a priming effect, because after the decline of Thaumarchaeota, the diversity and metabolic potential of the community increased back to the levels present at the start of the experiment. Our study demonstrates the profound versatility of deep microbial communities when facing organic carbon deprivation.},

            Diatoms constitute a diverse lineage of unicellular organisms abundant and ecologically important in aquatic ecosystems. Compared to other protists, their biology and taxonomy are well-studied, offering the opportunity to combine traditional approaches and new technologies. We examined a dataset of diatom 18S rRNA- and rDNA- (V4 region) reads from different plankton size-fractions and sediments from six European coastal marine sites, with the aim of identifying peculiarities and commonalities with respect to the whole protistan community. Almost all metabarcodes (99.6\%) were assigned to known genera (121) and species (236), the most abundant of which were those already known from classic studies and coincided with those seen in light microscopy. rDNA and rRNA showed comparable patterns for the dominant taxa, but rRNA revealed a much higher diversity particularly in the sediment communities. Peculiar to diatoms is a tight bentho-pelagic coupling, with many benthic or planktonic species colonizing both water column and sediments and the dominance of planktonic species in both habitats. Overall metabarcoding results reflected the marked specificity of diatoms compared to other protistan groups in terms of morphological and ecological characteristics, at the same time confirming their great potential in the description of protist communities.},

effect of inorganic nutrients on planktonic assemblages has traditionally
relied on concentrations rather than estimates of nutrient supply. We
combined a novel dataset of hydrographic properties, turbulent mixing,
nutrient concentration, and picoplankton community composition with the aims
of (i) quantifying the role of temperature, light, and nitrate fluxes as
factors controlling the distribution of autotrophic and heterotrophic
picoplankton subgroups, as determined by flow cytometry, and (ii) describing
the ecological niches of the various components of the picoplankton
community. Data were collected at 97 stations in the Atlantic Ocean,
including tropical and subtropical open-ocean waters, the northwestern
Mediterranean Sea, and the Galician coastal upwelling system of the northwest
Iberian Peninsula. A generalized additive model (GAM) approach was used to
predict depth-integrated biomass of each picoplankton subgroup based on three
niche predictors: sea surface temperature, averaged daily surface irradiance,
and the transport of nitrate into the euphotic zone, through both diffusion
and advection. In addition, niche overlap among different picoplankton
subgroups was computed using nonparametric kernel density functions.
Temperature and nitrate supply were more relevant than light in predicting
the biomass of most picoplankton subgroups, except for
Prochlorococcus and low-nucleic-acid (LNA) prokaryotes, for which irradiance also played a
significant role. Nitrate supply was the only factor that allowed the
distinction among the ecological niches of all autotrophic and heterotrophic
picoplankton subgroups. Prochlorococcus and LNA prokaryotes were
more abundant in warmer waters ({\textgreater}20 ∘C) where the nitrate fluxes
were low, whereas Synechococcus and high-nucleic-acid (HNA)
prokaryotes prevailed mainly in cooler environments characterized by
intermediate or high levels of nitrate supply. Finally, the niche of
picoeukaryotes was defined by low temperatures and high nitrate supply. These
results support the key role of nitrate supply, as it not only promotes the
growth of large phytoplankton, but it also controls the structure of marine
picoplankton communities.},

            Global patterns of planktonic diversity are mainly determined by the dispersal of propagules with ocean currents. However, the role that abundance and body size play in determining spatial patterns of diversity remains unclear. Here we analyse spatial community structure - β-diversity - for several planktonic and nektonic organisms from prokaryotes to small mesopelagic fishes collected during the Malaspina 2010 Expedition. β-diversity was compared to surface ocean transit times derived from a global circulation model, revealing a significant negative relationship that is stronger than environmental differences. Estimated dispersal scales for different groups show a negative correlation with body size, where less abundant large-bodied communities have significantly shorter dispersal scales and larger species spatial turnover rates than more abundant small-bodied plankton. Our results confirm that the dispersal scale of planktonic and micro-nektonic organisms is determined by local abundance, which scales with body size, ultimately setting global spatial patterns of diversity.},

            Although animals are among the best studied organisms, we still lack a full description of their diversity, especially for microscopic taxa. This is partly due to the time-consuming and costly nature of surveying animal diversity through morphological and molecular studies of individual taxa. A powerful alternative is the use of high-throughput environmental sequencing, providing molecular data from all organisms sampled. We here address the unknown diversity of animal phyla in marine environments using an extensive dataset designed to assess eukaryotic ribosomal diversity among European coastal locations. A multi-phylum assessment of marine animal diversity that includes water column and sediments, oxic and anoxic environments, and both DNA and RNA templates, revealed a high percentage of novel 18S rRNA sequences in most phyla, suggesting that marine environments have not yet been fully sampled at a molecular level. This novelty is especially high among Platyhelminthes, Acoelomorpha, and Nematoda, which are well studied from a morphological perspective and abundant in benthic environments. We also identified, based on molecular data, a potentially novel group of widespread tunicates. Moreover, we recovered a high number of reads for Ctenophora and Cnidaria in the smaller fractions suggesting their gametes might play a greater ecological role than previously suspected.},

              Single-celled eukaryotes (protists) are critical players in global biogeochemical cycling of nutrients and energy in the oceans. While their roles as primary producers and grazers are well appreciated, other aspects of their life histories remain obscure due to challenges in culturing and sequencing their natural diversity. Here, we exploit single-cell genomics and metagenomics data from the circumglobal
              Tara
              Oceans expedition to analyze the genome content and apparent oceanic distribution of seven prevalent lineages of uncultured heterotrophic stramenopiles. Based on the available data, each sequenced genome or genotype appears to have a specific oceanic distribution, principally correlated with water temperature and depth. The genome content provides hypotheses for specialization in terms of cell motility, food spectra, and trophic stages, including the potential impact on their lifestyles of horizontal gene transfer from prokaryotes. Our results support the idea that prominent heterotrophic marine protists perform diverse functions in ocean ecology.},

	abstract = {Significance
            Prokaryotes dominate the living biomass and the biological diversity of the ocean, one of the largest ecosystems on earth. The sinking of particles is a widespread mechanism that transports materials to the deep ocean, with a significant role in the global carbon cycle. Whether this process constitutes a global dispersal pathway for prokaryotic diversity connecting surface communities to those in the dark ocean has never been tested. Here we show that surface and deep-sea prokaryotic communities are strongly connected, constituting a vast oceanic metacommunity where local assemblages are linked through the transport of sinking particles. This vertical dispersal, mediated mainly by the largest sinking particles, emerges as a fundamental process shaping the assembly and biogeography of deep ocean prokaryotic communities.
          , 
            The sinking of organic particles formed in the photic layer is a main vector of carbon export into the deep ocean. Although sinking particles are heavily colonized by microbes, so far it has not been explored whether this process plays a role in transferring prokaryotic diversity from surface to deep oceanic layers. Using Illumina sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene, we explore here the vertical connectivity of the ocean microbiome by characterizing marine prokaryotic communities associated with five different size fractions and examining their compositional variability from surface down to 4,000 m across eight stations sampled in the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans during the Malaspina 2010 Expedition. Our results show that the most abundant prokaryotes in the deep ocean are also present in surface waters. This vertical community connectivity seems to occur predominantly through the largest particles because communities in the largest size fractions showed the highest taxonomic similarity throughout the water column, whereas free-living communities were more isolated vertically. Our results further suggest that particle colonization processes occurring in surface waters determine to some extent the composition and biogeography of bathypelagic communities. Overall, we postulate that sinking particles function as vectors that inoculate viable particle-attached surface microbes into the deep-sea realm, determining to a considerable extent the structure, functioning, and biogeography of deep ocean communities.},

              In this work, they compared patterns of abundant and rare picoeukaryotic sub‐communities in the epipelagic waters (surface and 40–75 m depth subsurface layers) of the East and South China Seas across seasons via 454 pyrosequencing of the V4 region of 18S rDNA. They also examined the relative effects of environmental filtering, dispersal limitations and seasonality on community assembly. Their results indicated that (i) in the surface layer, abundant taxa are primarily influenced by dispersal limitations and rare taxa are primarily influenced by environmental filtering, whereas (ii) in the subsurface layer, both abundant and rare sub‐communities are only weakly influenced by environmental filtering but are strongly influenced by dispersal limitations. Moreover, (iii) abundant taxa exhibit stronger temporal variability than rare taxa. They also found that abundant and rare sub‐communities display similar spatial richness patterns that are negatively correlated with latitude and chlorophyll
              a
              and positively correlated with temperature. In summary, environmental filtering and dispersal limitations have different effects on abundant and rare picoeukaryotic sub‐communities in different layers. Thus, depth appears as an essential variable that governs the structuring patterns of picoeukaryotic communities in the oceans and should be thoroughly considered to develop a more comprehensive understanding of oceanic microbial assemblages.},

            Pico-sized eukaryotes play key roles in the functioning of marine ecosystems, but we still have a limited knowledge on their ecology and evolution. The MAST-4 lineage is of particular interest, since it is widespread in surface oceans, presents ecotypic differentiation and has defied culturing efforts so far. Single cell genomics (SCG) are promising tools to retrieve genomic information from these uncultured organisms. However, SCG are based on whole genome amplification, which normally introduces amplification biases that limit the amount of genomic data retrieved from a single cell. Here, we increase the recovery of genomic information from two MAST-4 lineages by co-assembling short reads from multiple Single Amplified Genomes (SAGs) belonging to evolutionary closely related cells. We found that complementary genomic information is retrieved from different SAGs, generating co-assembly that features {\textgreater}74\% of genome recovery, against about 20\% when assembled individually. Even though this approach is not aimed at generating high-quality draft genomes, it allows accessing to the genomic information of microbes that would otherwise remain unreachable. Since most of the picoeukaryotes still remain uncultured, our work serves as a proof-of-concept that can be applied to other taxa in order to extract genomic data and address new ecological and evolutionary questions.},

              Oceans expeditions (2009–2013), targeting plankton organisms ranging from viruses to metazoans, and providing rich environmental context measurements. Thanks to recent advances in the field of genomics, extensive sequencing has been performed for a deep genomic analysis of this huge collection of samples. A strategy based on different approaches, such as metabarcoding, metagenomics, single-cell genomics and metatranscriptomics, has been chosen for analysis of size-fractionated plankton communities.

A simple but unconventional sampling strategy allowed examining the vertical structure with ca. 2 m resolution. The distribution of

              ,
              Synechococcus
              , chlorophytes, pelagophytes, small prymnesiophytes, coccolithophores, diatoms, and dinoflagellates was investigated with a combination of pigment‐markers, flow cytometry and optical and FISH microscopy. All groups presented minimum abundances at the surface and a maximum in the DCM layer. The cell distribution was not vertically symmetrical around the DCM peak and cells tended to accumulate in the upper part of the DCM layer. The more symmetrical distribution of chlorophyll than cells around the DCM peak was due to the increase of pigment per cell with depth. We found a vertical alignment of phytoplankton groups within the DCM layer indicating preferences for different ecological niches in a layer with strong gradients of light and nutrients.
              Prochlorococcus
              occupied the shallowest and diatoms the deepest layers. Dinoflagellates,
              Synechococcus
              and small prymnesiophytes preferred shallow DCM layers, and coccolithophores, chlorophytes and pelagophytes showed a preference for deep layers. Cell size within groups changed with depth in a pattern related to their mean size: the cell volume of the smallest group increased the most with depth while the cell volume of the largest group decreased the most. The vertical alignment of phytoplankton groups confirms that the DCM is not a homogeneous entity and indicates groups’ preferences for different ecological niches within this layer.},

Two top‐down (grazing) and bottom‐up (phosphorus (P) availability) manipulation experiments were conducted under different light regimes in the NW Mediterranean Sea. Growth rate of different phylogenetic groups, including the Bacteroidetes,

However, nutrient supply in the oligotrophic ocean is largely dependent on the recycling of organic matter.

              in the subtropical and tropical ocean, with βG increasing the fastest with warming, followed by LAP, while AP showed the smallest increase. The estimated activation energies predict that the hydrolysis products under projected warming scenarios will have higher C:N, C:P and N:P molar ratios than those currently generated, and suggest that the warming of oceanic surface waters leads to a decline in the nutrient supply to the microbial heterotrophic community relative to that of carbon, particularly so for phosphorus, slowing down nutrient recycling and contributing to further ocean oligotrophication.},

            Aerobic anoxygenic phototrophic (AAP) bacteria are microorganisms that can harvest light energy using bacteriochlorophyll a to supplement their predominantly organotrophic metabolism. Growth enhancement by light has repeatedly been demonstrated in laboratory experiments with AAP isolates. However, the ecological advantage of light utilization is unclear, as it has never been proven in the natural environment. Here, we conducted manipulation experiments in the NW Mediterranean and found that AAP bacteria display high growth rates which are controlled to a large extent by intense grazing pressure and phosphorous availability. Foremost, we found that, contrarily to the bulk bacterioplakton, AAP bacteria display higher growth rates when incubated under light-dark cycles than in complete darkness. These results represent the first direct evidence that natural populations of marine AAP bacteria can be stimulated by light.},

            Depending on their relationship with the pelagic particulate matter, planktonic prokaryotes have traditionally been classified into two types of communities: free-living (FL) or attached (ATT) to particles, and are generally separated using only one pore-size filter in a differential filtration. Nonetheless, particulate matter in the oceans appears in a continuum of sizes. Here we separated this continuum into six discrete size-fractions, from 0.2 to 200 μm, and described the prokaryotes associated to each of them. Each size-fraction presented different bacterial communities, with a range of 23–42\% of unique (OTUs) in each size-fraction, supporting the idea that they contained distinct types of particles. An increase in richness was observed from the smallest to the largest size-fractions, suggesting that increasingly larger particles contributed new niches. Our results show that a multiple size-fractionation provides a more exhaustive description of the bacterial diversity and community structure than the use of only one filter. In addition, and based on our results, we propose an alternative to the dichotomy of FL or ATT lifestyles, in which we differentiate the taxonomic groups with preference for the smaller fractions, those that do not show preferences for small or large fractions, and those that preferentially appear in larger fractions.},

              Picocyanobacteria can occur as single‐cell (Pcy) or as colonies (CPcy). Published evidence suggests that some Pcy strains have the capability to aggregate under certain culture conditions, however this has not been demonstrated to occur in natural environments. We investigated whether the Pcy and CPcy belong to the same species (i.e. phylotype), and the factors that determine their morphological and genetic variability in a hypertrophic shallow lake dominated by picocyanobacteria. Six main different morphologies and {\textgreater}30 phylotypes were observed. All sequences retrieved belonged to the ‘
              Anathece + Cyanobium
              ’ clade (Synechococcales) that are known to have the capability of aggregation/disaggregation. The temporal variation of picocyanobacteria morphotype composition was weakly correlated with the DGGE temporal pattern, and could be explained by the composition of the zooplankton assemblage. Laboratory experiments confirmed that the small cladoceran
              Bosmina
              favoured the dominance of CPcy, i.e.
              Cyanodictyon
              doubled the size of the colonies when present, most likely through the aggregation of single‐cell picocyanobacteria into colonies. Flow cytometry cell sorting and 16S rRNA + ITS sequencing of the Pcy and CPcy cytometrically‐defined populations revealed that some phylotypes could be found in both sorted populations, suggesting phenotypic plasticity in which various Synechococcales phylotypes could be found

            Prasinophytes occur in all oceans but rarely dominate phytoplankton populations. In contrast, a single ecotype of the prasinophyte Micromonas is frequently the most abundant photosynthetic taxon reported in the Arctic from summer through autumn. However, seasonal dynamics of prasinophytes outside of this period are little known. To address this, we analyzed high-throughput V4 18S rRNA amplicon data collected from November to July in the Amundsen Gulf Region, Beaufort Sea, Arctic. Surprisingly during polar sunset in November and December, we found a high proportion of reads from both DNA and RNA belonging to another prasinophyte, Bathycoccus. We then analyzed a metagenome from a December sample and the resulting Bathycoccus metagenome assembled genome (MAG) covered {\textasciitilde}90\% of the Bathycoccus Ban7 reference genome. In contrast, only {\textasciitilde}20\% of a reference Micromonas genome was found in the metagenome. Our phylogenetic analysis of marker genes placed the Arctic Bathycoccus in the B1 coastal clade. In addition, substitution rates of 129 coding DNA sequences were {\textasciitilde}1.6\% divergent between the Arctic MAG and coastal Chilean upwelling MAGs and 17.3\% between it and a South East Atlantic open ocean MAG in the B2 Clade. The metagenomic analysis also revealed a winter viral community highly skewed toward viruses targeting Micromonas, with a much lower diversity of viruses targeting Bathycoccus. Overall a combination of Micromonas being relatively less able to maintain activity under dark winter conditions and viral suppression of Micromonas may have contributed to the success of Bathycoccus in the Amundsen Gulf during winter.},

            Microbes drive ecosystems under constraints imposed by viruses. However, a lack of virus genome information hinders our ability to answer fundamental, biological questions concerning microbial communities. Here we apply single-virus genomics (SVGs) to assess whether portions of marine viral communities are missed by current techniques. The majority of the here-identified 44 viral single-amplified genomes (vSAGs) are more abundant in global ocean virome data sets than published metagenome-assembled viral genomes or isolates. This indicates that vSAGs likely best represent the dsDNA viral populations dominating the oceans. Species-specific recruitment patterns and virome simulation data suggest that vSAGs are highly microdiverse and that microdiversity hinders the metagenomic assembly, which could explain why their genomes have not been identified before. Altogether, SVGs enable the discovery of some of the likely most abundant and ecologically relevant marine viral species, such as vSAG 37-F6, which were overlooked by other methodologies.},

            Biotic and abiotic particles shape the microspatial architecture that defines the microbial aquatic habitat, being particles highly variable in size and quality along oceanic horizontal and vertical gradients. We analysed the prokaryotic (bacterial and archaeal) diversity and community composition present in six distinct particle size classes ranging from the pico‐ to the microscale (0.2 to 200 μm). Further, we studied their variations along oceanographic horizontal (from the coast to open oceanic waters) and vertical (from the ocean surface into the meso‐ and bathypelagic ocean) gradients. In general, prokaryotic community composition was more variable with depth than in the transition from the coast to the open ocean. Comparing the six size‐fractions, distinct prokaryotic communities were detected in each size‐fraction, and whereas bacteria were more diverse in the larger size‐fractions, archaea were more diverse in the smaller size‐fractions. Comparison of prokaryotic community composition among particle size‐fractions showed that most, but not all, taxonomic groups have a preference for a certain size‐fraction sustained with depth. Species sorting, or the presence of diverse ecotypes with distinct size‐fraction preferences, may explain why this trend is not conserved in all taxa.},

              Here we assess the temperature dependence of the metabolic rates (gross primary production (GPP), community respiration (CR), and the ratio GPP/CR) of oceanic plankton communities. We compile data from 133 stations of the Malaspina 2010 Expedition, distributed among the subtropical and tropical Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian oceans. We used the in vitro technique to measured metabolic rates during 24 h incubations at three different sampled depths: surface, 20\%, and 1\% of the photosynthetically active radiation measured at surface. We also measured the \% of ultraviolet B radiation (UVB) penetrating at surface waters. GPP and CR rates increased with warming, albeit different responses were observed for each sampled depth. The overall GPP/CR ratio declined with warming. Higher activation energies (

               = −0.13 eV). We believe that the difference between previous assessments and the ones presented here can be explained by the overrepresentation of Atlantic communities in the previous data sets. We found that UVB radiation also affects the temperature dependence of surface GPP, which decreased rather than increased under high levels of UVB. Ocean warming, which causes stratification and oligotrophication of the subtropical and tropical oceans, may lead to reduced surface GPP as a result of increased penetration of UVB radiation.

              Planktonic heterotrophic prokaryotes make up the largest living biomass and process most organic matter in the ocean. Determining when and where the biomass and activity of heterotrophic prokaryotes are controlled by resource availability (bottom‐up), predation and viral lysis (top‐down) or temperature will help in future carbon cycling predictions. We conducted an extensive survey across subtropical and tropical waters of the Atlantic, Indian and Pacific Oceans during the Malaspina 2010 Global Circumnavigation Expedition and assessed indices for these three types of controls at 109 stations (mostly from the surface to 4,000 m depth). Temperature control was approached by the apparent activation energy in
              eV
              (ranging from 0.46 to 3.41), bottom‐up control by the slope of the log‐log relationship between biomass and production rate (ranging from −0.12 to 1.09) and top‐down control by an index that considers the relative abundances of heterotrophic nanoflagellates and viruses (ranging from 0.82 to 4.83). We conclude that temperature becomes dominant (i.e. activation energy {\textgreater}1.5 
              eV
              ) within a narrow window of intermediate values of bottom‐up (0.3–0.6) and top‐down 0.8–1.2) controls. A pervasive latitudinal pattern of decreasing temperature regulation towards the Equator, regardless of the oceanic basin, suggests that the impact of global warming on marine microbes and their biogeochemical function will be more intense at higher latitudes. Our analysis predicts that 1°C ocean warming will result in increased biomass of heterotrophic prokaryoplankton only in waters with {\textless}26°C of mean annual surface temperature.},

We assessed patterns in viral abundance and production and the role of viral lysis as a driver of prokaryote mortality, from surface to bathypelagic layers, across the tropical and subtropical oceans.

Free viruses had turnover times of 0.1 days in the bathypelagic, revealing that viruses in the bathypelagic are highly dynamic.

            Mixotrophs combine photosynthesis with phagotrophy to cover their demands in energy and essential nutrients. This gives them a competitive advantage under oligotropihc conditions, where nutrients and bacteria concentrations are low. As the advantage for the mixotroph depends on light, the competition between mixo- and heterotrophic bacterivores should be regulated by light. To test this hypothesis, we incubated natural plankton from the ultra-oligotrophic Eastern Mediterranean in a set of mesocosms maintained at 4 light levels spanning a 10-fold light gradient. Picoplankton (heterotrophic bacteria (HB), pico-sized cyanobacteria, and small-sized flagellates) showed the fastest and most marked response to light, with pronounced predator-prey cycles, in the high-light treatments. Albeit cell specific activity of heterotrophic bacteria was constant across the light gradient, bacterial abundances exhibited an inverse relationship with light. This pattern was explained by light-induced top-down control of HB by bacterivorous phototrophic eukaryotes (PE), which was evidenced by a significant inverse relationship between HB net growth rate and PE abundances. Our results show that light mediates the impact of mixotrophic bacterivores. As mixo- and heterotrophs differ in the way they remineralize nutrients, these results have far-reaching implications for how nutrient cycling is affected by light.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Some prokaryotes are known to be specialized in the use of phytoplankton-derived dissolved organic carbon (DOCp) originated by exudation or cell lysis; however, direct quantification measurements are extremely rare. Several studies have described bacterial selectivity based on DOCp quality, but very few have focused on the quantity of DOCp, and the relative importance of each of these variables (for example, quantity versus quality) on prokaryote responses. We applied an adapted version of the MAR-FISH (microautoradiography coupled with catalyzed reporter deposition fluorescence in situ hybridization) protocol using radiolabelled exudates from axenic algal cultures to calculate a specialization index (d’) for large bacterioplankton phylogenetic groups using DOCp from different phytoplankton species and at different concentrations to elucidate to what extent the bacterial response to DOCp is driven by resource quantity (different DOCp concentrations) or by quality (DOCp from different phytoplankton species). All bacterial phylogenetic groups studied had lower d’ at higher DOCp concentration, indicating more generalist behavior at higher resource availabilities. Indeed, at increasing resource concentrations, most bacterial groups incorporated DOCp indiscriminately, regardless of its origin (or quality). At low resource concentrations, only some specialists were able to actively incorporate the various types of organic matter effectively. The variability of bacterial responses to different treatments was systematically higher at varying concentrations than at varying DOCp types, suggesting that, at least for this range of concentrations (10–100 μM), DOCp quantity affects bacterial responses more than quality does. Therefore, resource quantity may be more relevant than resource quality in the bacterial responses to DOCp and affect how bacterioplankton use phytoplankton-derived carbon.},

            We investigated the effects of an increase in dissolved CO2 on the microbial communities of the Mediterranean Sea during two mesocosm experiments in two contrasting seasons: winter, at the peak of the annual phytoplankton bloom, and summer, under low nutrient conditions. The experiments included treatments with acidification and nutrient addition, and combinations of the two. We followed the effects of ocean acidification (OA) on the abundance of the main groups of microorganisms (diatoms, dinoflagellates, nanoeukaryotes, picoeukaryotes, cyanobacteria, and heterotrophic bacteria) and on bacterial activity, leucine incorporation, and extracellular enzyme activity. Our results showed a clear stimulation effect of OA on the abundance of small phytoplankton (pico- and nanoeukaryotes), independently of the season and nutrient availability. A large number of the measured variables showed significant positive effects of acidification in summer compared with winter, when the effects were sometimes negative. Effects of OA were more conspicuous when nutrient concentrations were low. Our results therefore suggest that microbial communities in oligotrophic waters are considerably affected by OA, whereas microbes in more productive waters are less affected. The overall enhancing effect of acidification on eukaryotic pico- and nanophytoplankton, in comparison with the non-significant or even negative response to nutrient-rich conditions of larger groups and autotrophic prokaryotes, suggests a shift towards medium-sized producers in a future acidified ocean.},

            The unicellular cyanobacterium UCYN-A, one of the major contributors to nitrogen fixation in the open ocean, lives in symbiosis with single-celled phytoplankton. UCYN-A includes several closely related lineages whose partner fidelity, genome-wide expression and time of evolutionary divergence remain to be resolved. Here we detect and distinguish UCYN-A1 and UCYN-A2 lineages in symbiosis with two distinct prymnesiophyte partners in the South Atlantic Ocean. Both symbiotic systems are lineage specific and differ in the number of UCYN-A cells involved. Our analyses infer a streamlined genome expression towards nitrogen fixation in both UCYN-A lineages. Comparative genomics reveal a strong purifying selection in UCYN-A1 and UCYN-A2 with a diversification process ∼91 Myr ago, in the late Cretaceous, after the low-nutrient regime period occurred during the Jurassic. These findings suggest that UCYN-A diversified in a co-evolutionary process, wherein their prymnesiophyte partners acted as a barrier driving an allopatric speciation of extant UCYN-A lineages.},

              Metagenomics has become an accessible approach to study complex microbial communities thanks to the advent of high-throughput sequencing technologies. However, molecular ecology studies often face interpretation issues, notably due to the lack of reliable reference databases for assigning reads to the correct taxa and use of fixed cutoffs to delineate taxonomic groups. Here, we considerably refined the phylogeography of marine picocyanobacteria, responsible for about 25\% of global marine productivity, by recruiting reads targeting a high-resolution marker from
              Tara
              Oceans metagenomes. By clustering lineages based on their distribution patterns, we showed that there is significant diversity at a finer resolution than the currently defined “ecotypes,” a diversity that is tightly controlled by environmental cues.

              Tara

              petB
              sequences were successfully assembled from metagenomic reads, significantly enriching the reference database. We then defined Ecologically Significant Taxonomic Units (ESTUs)—that is, organisms belonging to the same clade and occupying a common oceanic niche. Three major ESTU assemblages were identified along the cruise transect for
              Prochlorococcus
              and eight for
              Synechococcus

              Prochlorococcus
              HLIIIA and HLIVA ESTUs codominated in iron-depleted areas of the Pacific Ocean, CRD1 and the yet-to-be cultured EnvB were the prevalent
              Synechococcus
              clades in this area, with three different CRD1 and EnvB ESTUs occupying distinct ecological niches with regard to iron availability and temperature. Sharp community shifts were also observed over short geographic distances—for example, around the Marquesas Islands or between southern Indian and Atlantic Oceans—pointing to a tight correlation between ESTU assemblages and specific physico-chemical parameters. Together, this study demonstrates that there is a previously overlooked, ecologically meaningful, fine-scale diversity within some currently defined picocyanobacterial ecotypes, bringing novel insights into the ecology, diversity, and biology of the two most abundant phototrophs on Earth.},

              Fluorescent dissolved organic matter (FDOM) in open surface waters ({\textless} 200 m) of the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian oceans was analysed by excitation‐emission matrix (EEM) spectroscopy and parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC). A four‐component PARAFAC model was fit to the EEMs, which included two humic‐ (C1 and C2) and two amino acid‐like (C3 and C4) components previously identified in ocean waters. Generalized‐additive models (GAMs) were used to explore the environmental factors that drive the global distribution of these PARAFAC components. The explained variance for the humic‐like components was substantially larger ({\textgreater} 70\%) than for the amino acid‐like components ({\textless} 35\%). The environmental variables exhibiting the largest effect on the global distribution of C1 and C2 were apparent oxygen utilisation followed by chlorophyll
              a
              . Positive non‐linear relationships between both predictor variables and the two humic‐like PARAFAC components suggest that their distribution are biologically controlled. Compared with the dark ocean ({\textgreater} 200 m), the relationships of C1 and C2 with AOU indicate a higher C1/AOU and C2/AOU ratios of the humic‐like substances in the dark ocean than in the surface ocean where a net effect of photobleaching is also detected. C3 (tryptophan‐like) and C4 (tyrosine‐like) variability was mostly dictated by salinity (
              S
              ), by means of positive non‐linear relationships, suggesting a primary physical control of their distributions at the global surface ocean scale that could be related to the changing evaporation‐precipitation regime. Remarkably, bacterial biomass (BB) only contributed to explain a minor part of the variability of C1 and C4.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT
            
              High-throughput sequencing (HTS) is revolutionizing environmental surveys of microbial diversity in the three domains of life by providing detailed information on which taxa are present in microbial assemblages. However, it is still unclear how the relative abundance of specific taxa gathered by HTS correlates with cell abundances. Here, we quantified the relative cell abundance of 6 picoeukaryotic taxa in 13 planktonic samples from 6 European coastal sites using epifluorescence microscopy on tyramide signal amplification-fluorescence
              in situ
              hybridization preparations. These relative abundance values were then compared with HTS data obtained in three separate molecular surveys: 454 sequencing of the V4 region of the 18S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) using DNA and RNA extracts (DNA-V4 and cDNA-V4) and Illumina sequencing of the V9 region (cDNA-V9). The microscopic and molecular signals were generally correlated, indicating that a relative increase in specific 18S rDNA was the result of a large proportion of cells in the given taxa. Despite these positive correlations, the slopes often deviated from 1, precluding a direct translation of sequences to cells. Our data highlighted clear differences depending on the nucleic acid template or the 18S rDNA region targeted. Thus, the molecular signal obtained using cDNA templates was always closer to relative cell abundances, while the V4 and V9 regions gave better results depending on the taxa. Our data support the quantitative use of HTS data but warn about considering it as a direct proxy of cell abundances.
            
            
              IMPORTANCE
              Direct studies on marine picoeukaryotes by epifluorescence microscopy are problematic due to the lack of morphological features and due to the limited number and poor resolution of specific phylogenetic probes used in fluorescence
              in situ
              hybridization (FISH) routines. As a consequence, there is an increasing use of molecular methods, including high-throughput sequencing (HTS), to study marine microbial diversity. HTS can provide a detailed picture of the taxa present in a community and can reveal diversity not evident using other methods, but it is still unclear what the meaning of the sequence abundance in a given taxon is. Our aim is to investigate the correspondence between the relative HTS signal and relative cell abundances in selected picoeukaryotic taxa. Environmental sequencing provides reasonable estimates of the relative abundance of specific taxa. Better results are obtained when using RNA extracts as the templates, while the region of 18S ribosomal DNA had different influences depending on the taxa assayed.},

            A marine symbiosis has been recently discovered between prymnesiophyte species and the unicellular diazotrophic cyanobacterium UCYN-A. At least two different UCYN-A phylotypes exist, the clade UCYN-A1 in symbiosis with an uncultured small prymnesiophyte and the clade UCYN-A2 in symbiosis with the larger Braarudosphaera bigelowii. We targeted the prymnesiophyte–UCYN-A1 symbiosis by double CARD-FISH (catalyzed reporter deposition-fluorescence in situ hybridization) and analyzed its abundance in surface samples from the MALASPINA circumnavigation expedition. Our use of a specific probe for the prymnesiophyte partner allowed us to verify that this algal species virtually always carried the UCYN-A symbiont, indicating that the association was also obligate for the host. The prymnesiophyte–UCYN-A1 symbiosis was detected in all ocean basins, displaying a patchy distribution with abundances (up to 500 cells ml−1) that could vary orders of magnitude. Additional vertical profiles taken at the NE Atlantic showed that this symbiosis occupied the upper water column and disappeared towards the Deep Chlorophyll Maximum, where the biomass of the prymnesiophyte assemblage peaked. Moreover, sequences of both prymnesiophyte partners were searched within a large 18S rDNA metabarcoding data set from the Tara-Oceans expedition around the world. This sequence-based analysis supported the patchy distribution of the UCYN-A1 host observed by CARD-FISH and highlighted an unexpected homogeneous distribution (at low relative abundance) of B. bigelowii in the open ocean. Our results demonstrate that partners are always in symbiosis in nature and show contrasted ecological patterns of the two related lineages.},

            The deep-sea is the largest biome of the biosphere, and contains more than half of the whole ocean’s microbes. Uncovering their general patterns of diversity and community structure at a global scale remains a great challenge, as only fragmentary information of deep-sea microbial diversity exists based on regional-scale studies. Here we report the first globally comprehensive survey of the prokaryotic communities inhabiting the bathypelagic ocean using high-throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. This work identifies the dominant prokaryotes in the pelagic deep ocean and reveals that 50\% of the operational taxonomic units (OTUs) belong to previously unknown prokaryotic taxa, most of which are rare and appear in just a few samples. We show that whereas the local richness of communities is comparable to that observed in previous regional studies, the global pool of prokaryotic taxa detected is modest ({\textasciitilde}3600 OTUs), as a high proportion of OTUs are shared among samples. The water masses appear to act as clear drivers of the geographical distribution of both particle-attached and free-living prokaryotes. In addition, we show that the deep-oceanic basins in which the bathypelagic realm is divided contain different particle-attached (but not free-living) microbial communities. The combination of the aging of the water masses and a lack of complete dispersal are identified as the main drivers for this biogeographical pattern. All together, we identify the potential of the deep ocean as a reservoir of still unknown biological diversity with a higher degree of spatial complexity than hitherto considered.},

            The assimilation of organic nutrients by autotrophs, a form of mixotrophy, has been demonstrated in the globally abundant marine picocyanobacterial genera Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus. However, the range of compounds used and the distribution of organic compound uptake genes within picocyanobacteria are unknown. Here we analyze genomic and metagenomic data from around the world to determine the extent and distribution of mixotrophy in these phototrophs. Analysis of 49 Prochlorococcus and 18 Synechococcus isolate genomes reveals that all have the transporters necessary to take up amino acids, peptides and sugars. However, the number and type of transporters and associated catabolic genes differ between different phylogenetic groups, with low-light IV Prochlorococcus, and 5.1B, 5.2 and 5.3 Synechococcus strains having the largest number. Metagenomic data from 68 stations from the Tara Oceans expedition indicate that the genetic potential for mixotrophy in picocyanobacteria is globally distributed and differs between clades. Phylogenetic analyses indicate gradual organic nutrient transporter gene loss from the low-light IV to the high-light II Prochlorococcus. The phylogenetic differences in genetic capacity for mixotrophy, combined with the ubiquity of picocyanobacterial organic compound uptake genes suggests that mixotrophy has a more central role in picocyanobacterial ecology than was previously thought.},

            In this work, we study the diversity of bathypelagic microbial eukaryotes (0.8–20 μm) in the global ocean. Seawater samples from 3000 to 4000 m depth from 27 stations in the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian Oceans were analyzed by pyrosequencing the V4 region of the 18S ribosomal DNA. The relative abundance of the most abundant operational taxonomic units agreed with the results of a parallel metagenomic analysis, suggesting limited PCR biases in the tag approach. Although rarefaction curves for single stations were seldom saturated, the global analysis of all sequences together suggested an adequate recovery of bathypelagic diversity. Community composition presented a large variability among samples, which was poorly explained by linear geographic distance. In fact, the similarity between communities was better explained by water mass composition (26\% of the variability) and the ratio in cell abundance between prokaryotes and microbial eukaryotes (21\%). Deep diversity appeared dominated by four taxonomic groups (Collodaria, Chrysophytes, Basidiomycota and MALV-II) appearing in different proportions in each sample. Novel diversity amounted to 1\% of the pyrotags and was lower than expected. Our study represents an essential step in the investigation of bathypelagic microbial eukaryotes, indicating dominating taxonomic groups and suggesting idiosyncratic assemblages in distinct oceanic regions.},

            Upon phosphorus (P) deficiency, marine phytoplankton reduce their requirements for P by replacing membrane phospholipids with alternative non-phosphorus lipids. It was very recently demonstrated that a SAR11 isolate also shares this capability when phosphate starved in culture. Yet, the extent to which this process occurs in other marine heterotrophic bacteria and in the natural environment is unknown. Here, we demonstrate that the substitution of membrane phospholipids for a variety of non-phosphorus lipids is a conserved response to P deficiency among phylogenetically diverse marine heterotrophic bacteria, including members of the Alphaproteobacteria and Flavobacteria. By deletion mutagenesis and complementation in the model marine bacterium Phaeobacter sp. MED193 and heterologous expression in recombinant Escherichia coli, we confirm the roles of a phospholipase C (PlcP) and a glycosyltransferase in lipid remodelling. Analyses of the Global Ocean Sampling and Tara Oceans metagenome data sets demonstrate that PlcP is particularly abundant in areas characterized by low phosphate concentrations. Furthermore, we show that lipid remodelling occurs seasonally and responds to changing nutrient conditions in natural microbial communities from the Mediterranean Sea. Together, our results point to the key role of lipid substitution as an adaptive strategy enabling heterotrophic bacteria to thrive in the vast P-depleted areas of the ocean.},

            To test whether protist grazing selectively affects the composition of aquatic bacterial communities, we combined high-throughput sequencing to determine bacterial community composition with analyses of grazing rates, protist and bacterial abundances and bacterial cell sizes and physiological states in a mesocosm experiment in which nutrients were added to stimulate a phytoplankton bloom. A large variability was observed in the abundances of bacteria (from 0.7 to 2.4 × 106 cells per ml), heterotrophic nanoflagellates (from 0.063 to 2.7 × 104 cells per ml) and ciliates (from 100 to 3000 cells per l) during the experiment (∼3-, 45- and 30-fold, respectively), as well as in bulk grazing rates (from 1 to 13 × 106 bacteria per ml per day) and bacterial production (from 3 to 379 μg per C l per day) (1 and 2 orders of magnitude, respectively). However, these strong changes in predation pressure did not induce comparable responses in bacterial community composition, indicating that bacterial community structure was resilient to changes in protist predation pressure. Overall, our results indicate that peaks in protist predation (at least those associated with phytoplankton blooms) do not necessarily trigger substantial changes in the composition of coastal marine bacterioplankton communities.},

            Microbial eukaryotes play important roles in aquatic ecosystem functioning. Unravelling their distribution patterns and biogeography provides important baseline information to infer the underlying mechanisms that regulate the biodiversity and complexity of ecosystems. We studied the distribution patterns and factors driving diversity gradients in microeukaryote communities (total, abundant, uncommon and rare community composition) along a latitudinal gradient of lakes distributed from Argentinean Patagonia to Maritime Antarctica using both denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and high‐throughput sequencing (Illumina HiSeq). DGGE and abundant Illumina operational taxonomic units (OTUs) showed both decreasing richness with latitude and significant differences between Patagonian and Antarctic lakes communities. In contrast, total richness did not change significantly across the latitudinal gradient, although evenness and diversity indices were significantly higher in Patagonian lakes. Beta‐diversity was characterized by a high species turnover, influenced by both environmental and geographical descriptors, although this pattern faded in the rare community. Our results suggest the co‐existence of a ‘core biosphere’ containing reduced number of abundant/dominant OTUs on which classical ecological rules apply, together with a much larger seedbank of rare OTUs driven by stochastic and reduced dispersal processes. These findings shed new light on the biogeographical patterns and forces structuring inland microeukaryote composition across broad spatial scales.},

              Ocean acidification is increasing and affects many marine organisms. However, certain sponge species can withstand low‐pH conditions. This may be related to their complex association with microbes. We hypothesized that species with greater microbial diversity may develop functional redundancy that could enable the holobiont to survive even if particular microbes are lost at low‐pH conditions. We evaluated the effects of acidification on the growth and associated microbes of three ubiquitous Mediterranean sponges by exposing them to the present pH level and that predicted for the year 2100. We found marked differences among the species in the acquisition of new microbes, being high in
              Dysidea avara
              , moderate in
              Agelas oroides
              and null in
              Chondrosia reniformis
              ; however, we did not observe variation in the overall microbiome abundance, richness or diversity. The relative abilities to alter the microbiomes contributes to survivorship in an OA scenario as demonstrated by lowered pH severely affecting the growth of
              C. reniformis
              , halving that of
              A. oroides
              , and unaffecting
              D. avara
              . Our results indicate that functional stability of the sponge holobiont to withstand future OA is species‐specific and is linked to the species’ ability to use horizontal transmission to modify the associated microbiome to adapt to environmental change.},

              Photosynthetic picoeukaryotes (PPEs) are fundamental contributors to oceanic primary production and form diverse communities dominated by prymnesiophytes, chlorophytes, pelagophytes and chrysophytes. Here, we studied the vertical distribution of these major groups in two offshore regions of the northern Iberian Peninsula during summer stratification. We performed a fine‐scale vertical sampling (every ∼2 m) across the DCM and used fluorescence
              in situ
              hybridization (FISH) to determine the PPE composition and to explore the possible segregation of target groups in the light, nutrient and temperature gradients. Chlorophytes, pelagophytes and prymnesiophytes, in this order of abundance, accounted for the total PPEs recorded by flow cytometry in the Avilés canyon, and for more than half in the Galicia Bank, whereas chrysophytes were undetected. Among the three detected groups, often the prymnesiophytes were dominant in biomass. In general, all groups were present throughout the water column with abundance peaks around the DCM, but their distributions differed: pelagophytes were located deeper than the other two groups, chlorophytes presented two peaks and prymnesiophytes exhibited surface abundances comparable to those at the DCM. This study offers first indications that the vertical distribution of different PPE groups is heterogeneous within the DCM.},

              The opisthokonts are one of the major super groups of eukaryotes. It comprises two major clades: (i) the
              M
              etazoa and their unicellular relatives and (ii) the
              F
              ungi and their unicellular relatives. There is, however, little knowledge of the role of opisthokont microbes in many natural environments, especially among non‐metazoan and non‐fungal opisthokonts. Here, we begin to address this gap by analysing high‐throughput 18
              S rDNA
              and 18
              S rRNA
              sequencing data from different European coastal sites, sampled at different size fractions and depths. In particular, we analyse the diversity and abundance of choanoflagellates, filastereans, ichthyosporeans, nucleariids, corallochytreans and their related lineages. Our results show the great diversity of choanoflagellates in coastal waters as well as a relevant representation of the ichthyosporeans and the uncultured marine opisthokonts (
              MAOP
              ). Furthermore, we describe a new lineage of marine fonticulids (
              MAFO
              ) that appears to be abundant in sediments. Taken together, our work points to a greater potential ecological role for unicellular opisthokonts than previously appreciated in marine environments, both in water column and sediments, and also provides evidence of novel opisthokont phylogenetic lineages. This study highlights the importance of high‐throughput sequencing approaches to unravel the diversity and distribution of both known and novel eukaryotic lineages.},

The peculiar local environment inside Agulhas rings may provide a selective mechanism contributing to the limited dispersal of Indian Ocean plankton populations into the Atlantic.},

Some can be identified by light microscopy, generally the largest and with conspicuous shapes, while the smallest can be counted by epifluorescence microscopy or flow cytometry but remain largely unidentified. Microbial diversity studies greatly advanced with the analysis of phylogenetic markers sequenced from natural assemblages. Molecular surveys began in 1990 targeting marine bacterioplankton (Giovannoni
              et al
              .
              
              ) and first approached microbial eukaryotes in three studies published in 2001 (Díez
              et al
              .
              
              ; López‐García
              et al
              .
              
              ; Moon‐van der Staay
              et al
              .
              
              ). These seminal studies, based on cloning and Sanger sequencing the complete 18S
              rDNA
              , were critical for obtaining broad pictures of microbial diversity in contrasted habitats and for describing novel lineages by robust phylogenies, but were limited by the number of sequences obtained. So, inventories of species richness in a given sample and community comparisons through environmental gradients were very incomplete. These limitations have been overcome with the advent of high‐throughput sequencing (
              HTS
              ) methods, initially 454‐pyrosequencing, today Illumina and soon others to come. In this issue of
              Molecular Ecology
              , Egge
              et al
              . (
              
              ) show a nice example of the use of
              HTS
              to study the biodiversity and seasonal succession of a particularly important group of marine microbial eukaryotes, the haptophytes. Temporal changes were analysed first at the community level, then at the clade level, and finally at the lowest rank comparable to species. Interesting and useful ecological insights were obtained at each taxonomic scale. Haptophyte diversity differed along seasons in a systematic manner, with some species showing seasonal preferences and others being always present. Many of these species had no correspondence with known species, pointing out the high level of novelty in microbial assemblages, only accessible by molecular tools. Moreover, the number of species detected was limited, agreeing with a putative scenario of constrained evolutionary diversification in free‐living small eukaryotes. This study illustrates the potential of
              HTS
              to address ecological relevant questions in an accessible way by processing large data sets that, nonetheless, need to be treated with a fair understanding of their limitations.},

            The dark ocean is one of the largest biomes on Earth, with critical roles in organic matter remineralization and global carbon sequestration. Despite its recognized importance, little is known about some key microbial players, such as the community of heterotrophic protists (HP), which are likely the main consumers of prokaryotic biomass. To investigate this microbial component at a global scale, we determined their abundance and biomass in deepwater column samples from the Malaspina 2010 circumnavigation using a combination of epifluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry. HP were ubiquitously found at all depths investigated down to 4000 m. HP abundances decreased with depth, from an average of 72±19 cells ml−1 in mesopelagic waters down to 11±1 cells ml−1 in bathypelagic waters, whereas their total biomass decreased from 280±46 to 50±14 pg C ml−1. The parameters that better explained the variance of HP abundance were depth and prokaryote abundance, and to lesser extent oxygen concentration. The generally good correlation with prokaryotic abundance suggested active grazing of HP on prokaryotes. On a finer scale, the prokaryote:HP abundance ratio varied at a regional scale, and sites with the highest ratios exhibited a larger contribution of fungi molecular signal. Our study is a step forward towards determining the relationship between HP and their environment, unveiling their importance as players in the dark ocean’s microbial food web.},

Here, we use a dual approach involving high-throughput diversity tag sequencing from both DNA and RNA templates and fluorescent cell counts to evaluate the diversity and relative abundance of fungi across marine samples taken from six European near-shore sites. We removed very rare fungal operational taxonomic units (OTUs) selecting only OTUs recovered from multiple samples for a detailed analysis. This approach identified a set of 71 fungal ‘OTU clusters' that account for 66\% of all the sequences assigned to the Fungi. Phylogenetic analyses demonstrated that this diversity includes a significant number of chytrid-like lineages that had not been previously described, indicating that the marine environment encompasses a number of zoosporic fungi that are new to taxonomic inventories. Using the sequence datasets, we identified cases where fungal OTUs were sampled across multiple geographical sites and between different sampling depths. This was especially clear in one relatively abundant and diverse phylogroup tentatively named Novel Chytrid-Like-Clade 1 (NCLC1). For comparison, a subset of the water column samples was also investigated using fluorescent microscopy to examine the abundance of eukaryotes with chitin cell walls. Comparisons of relative abundance of RNA-derived fungal tag sequences and chitin cell-wall counts demonstrate that fungi constitute a low fraction of the eukaryotic community in these water column samples. Taken together, these results demonstrate the phylogenetic position and environmental distribution of 71 lineages, improving our understanding of the diversity and abundance of fungi in marine environments.},

              The free‐living (

              ) and particle‐attached (
              PA
              ) marine microbial communities have repeatedly been proved to differ in their diversity and composition in the photic ocean and also recently in the bathypelagic ocean at a global scale. However, although high taxonomic ranks exhibit preferences for a
              PA
              or
              FL
              mode of life, it remains poorly understood whether two clear lifestyles do exist and how these are distributed across the prokaryotic phylogeny. We studied the
              FL
              ({\textless}0.8 μm) and
              PA
              (0.8–20 μm) prokaryotes at 30 stations distributed worldwide within the bathypelagic oceanic realm (2150–4000 m depth) using high‐throughput sequencing of the small subunit ribosomal
              RNA
              gene (16S
              rRNA
              ). A high proportion of the bathypelagic prokaryotes were mostly found either attached to particles or freely in the surrounding water but rarely in both types of environments. In particular, this trait was deeply conserved through their phylogeny, suggesting that the deep‐ocean particles and the surrounding water constitute two highly distinct niches and that transitions from one to the other have been rare at an evolutionary timescale. As a consequence,
              PA
              and
              FL
              communities had clear alpha‐ and beta‐diversity differences that exceeded the global‐scale geographical variation. Our study organizes the bathypelagic prokaryotic diversity into a reasonable number of ecologically coherent taxa regarding their association with particles, a first step for understanding which are the microbes responsible for the processing of the dissolved and particulate pools of organic matter that have a very different biogeochemical role in the deep ocean.},

              The transformation of leucine incorporation rates to prokaryotic carbon production rates requires the use of either theoretical or empirically determined conversion factors. Empirical leucine-to-carbon conversion factors (eCFs) vary widely across environments, and little is known about their potential controlling factors. We conducted 10 surface seawater manipulation experiments across the world's oceans, where the growth of the natural prokaryotic assemblages was promoted by filtration (i.e., removal of grazers [F treatment]) or filtration combined with dilution (i.e., also relieving resource competition [FD treatment]). The impact of sunlight exposure was also evaluated in the FD treatments, and we did not find a significant effect on the eCFs. The eCFs varied from 0.09 to 1.47 kg C mol Leu
              −1
              and were significantly lower in the FD than in the F samples. Also, changes in bacterial community composition during the incubations, as assessed by automated ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis (ARISA), were more pronounced in the FD than in the F treatments, compared to unmanipulated controls. Thus, we discourage the common procedure of diluting samples (in addition to filtration) for eCF determination. The eCFs in the filtered treatment were negatively correlated with the initial chlorophyll
              a
              concentration, picocyanobacterial abundance (mostly
              Prochlorococcus
              ), and the percentage of heterotrophic prokaryotes with high nucleic acid content (\%HNA). The latter two variables explained 80\% of the eCF variability in the F treatment, supporting the view that both
              Prochlorococcus
              and HNA prokaryotes incorporate leucine in substantial amounts, although this results in relatively low carbon production rates in the oligotrophic ocean.},

              The role of the ocean as a sink for CO
              2
              is partially dependent on the downward transport of phytoplankton cells packaged within fast-sinking particles. However, whether such fast-sinking mechanisms deliver fresh organic carbon down to the deep bathypelagic sea and whether this mechanism is prevalent across the ocean requires confirmation. Here we report the ubiquitous presence of healthy photosynthetic cells, dominated by diatoms, down to 4,000 m in the deep dark ocean. Decay experiments with surface phytoplankton suggested that the large proportion (18\%) of healthy photosynthetic cells observed, on average, in the dark ocean, requires transport times from a few days to a few weeks, corresponding to sinking rates (124–732 m d
              −1
              ) comparable to those of fast-sinking aggregates and faecal pellets. These results confirm the expectation that fast-sinking mechanisms inject fresh organic carbon into the deep sea and that this is a prevalent process operating across the global oligotrophic ocean.},

              DOM
              led to similar increases in bacterial carbon demand (238\% and 213\%) and decreases in bacterial growth efficiency (

              BGEs
              were caused by similar bacterial production but much higher bacterial respiration rates, which in turn were positively related to aminopeptidase activity. However, in the

              bacterial community dominated by
              Bacteroidetes

              Here we investigated whether there is evidence of local adaptation in strains of an ancestrally marine dinoflagellate to the lacustrine environment they now inhabit (optimal genotypes) and/or if they have evolved phenotypic plasticity (a range of phenotypes). Eleven strains of

              olarella glacialis
              were isolated and cultured from three different environments: the polar seas, a hyposaline and a hypersaline Antarctic lake. Local adaptation was tested by comparing growth rates of lacustrine and marine strains at their own and reciprocal site conditions. To determine phenotypic plasticity, we measured the reaction norm for salinity. We found evidence of both, limited local adaptation and higher phenotypic plasticity in lacustrine strains when compared with marine ancestors. At extreme high salinities, local lake strains outperformed other strains, and at extreme low salinities, strains from the hyposaline lake outperformed all other strains. The data suggest that lake populations may have evolved higher phenotypic plasticity in the lake habitats compared with the sea, presumably due to the high temporal variability in salinity in the lacustrine systems. Moreover, the interval of salinity tolerance differed between strains from the hyposaline and hypersaline lakes, indicating local adaptation promoted by different salinity.},

            Molecular surveys in planktonic marine systems have unveiled a large novel diversity of small protists. A large part of this diversity belongs to basal heterotrophic stramenopiles and is distributed in a set of polyphyletic ribogroups (described from rDNA sequences) collectively named as MAST (MArine STramenopiles). In the few groups investigated, MAST cells are globally distributed and abundant bacterial grazers, therefore having a putatively large impact on marine ecosystem functioning. The main aim of this study is to reevaluate the MAST ribogroups described so far and to determine whether additional groups can be found. For this purpose, we used traditional and state-of-the-art molecular tools, combining 18S rDNA sequences from publicly available clone libraries, single amplified genomes (SAGs) of planktonic protists, and a pyrosequencing survey from coastal waters and sediments. Our analysis indicated a final set of 18 MAST groups plus 5 new ribogroups within Ochrophyta (named as MOCH). The MAST ribogroups were then analyzed in more detail. Seven were typical of anoxic systems and one of oxic sediments. The rest were clearly members of oxic marine picoplankton. We characterized the genetic diversity within each MAST group and defined subclades for the more diverse (46 subclades in 8 groups). The analyses of sequences within subclades revealed further ecological specializations. Our data provide a renovated framework for phylogenetic classification of the numerous MAST ribogroups and support the notion of a tight link between phylogeny and ecological distribution. These diverse and largely uncultured protists are widespread and ecologically relevant members of marine microbial assemblages.},

	abstract = {Significance
            In vertebrates, the transition of postmeiotic spermatids into spermatozoa (spermiogenesis) is believed to occur indirectly in response to androgens released by the somatic Leydig cells after activation of the luteinizing hormone/choriogonadotropin receptor (LHCGR). In contrast to this indirect model, here we show that distantly related fishes express the homolog of the tetrapod LHCGR (Lhcgrba) also in germ cells, which directly drives spermiogenesis in response to the luteinizing hormone. Our findings reveal a nonsteroidal role of the Lhcgrba pathway in vertebrate germ cells with potential implications for the causes of male infertility.
          , 
            In both mammals and teleosts, the differentiation of postmeiotic spermatids to spermatozoa (spermiogenesis) is thought to be indirectly controlled by the luteinizing hormone (LH) acting through the LH/choriogonadotropin receptor (LHCGR) to stimulate androgen secretion in the interstitial Leydig cells. However, a more direct, nonsteroidal role of LH mediating the spermiogenic pathway remains unclear. Using a flatfish with semicystic spermatogenesis, in which spermatids are released into the seminiferous lobule lumen (SLL), where they develop into spermatozoa without direct contact with the supporting Sertoli cells, we show that haploid spermatids express the homolog of the tetrapod LHCGR (Lhcgrba). Both native Lh and intramuscularly injected His-tagged recombinant Lh (rLh) are immunodetected bound to the Lhcgrba of free spermatids in the SLL, showing that circulating gonadotropin can reach the intratubular compartment. In vitro incubation of flatfish spermatids isolated from the SLL with rLh specifically promotes their differentiation into spermatozoa, whereas recombinant follicle-stimulating hormone and steroid hormones are ineffective. Using a repertoire of molecular markers and inhibitors, we find that the Lh-Lhcgrba induction of spermiogenesis is mediated through a cAMP/PKA signaling pathway that initiates the transcription of genes potentially involved in the function of spermatozoa. We further show that Lhcgrba expression in germ cells also occurs in distantly related fishes, suggesting this feature is likely conserved in teleosts regardless of the type of germ cell development. These data reveal a role of LH in vertebrate germ cells, whereby a Lhcgrba-activated signaling cascade in haploid spermatids directs gene expression and the progression of spermiogenesis.},

            Grazing rate estimates indicate that approximately half of the bacterivory in oligotrophic oceans is due to mixotrophic flagellates (MFs). However, most estimations have considered algae as a single group. Here we aimed at opening the black-box of the phytoflagellates (PFs) \&lt;20 μm. Haptophytes, chlorophytes, cryptophytes and pigmented dinoflagellates were identified using fluorescent in situ hybridization or by standard 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole staining. Their fluctuations in abundance, cell size, biomass and bacterivory rates were measured through an annual cycle in an oligotrophic coastal system. On average, we were able to assign to these groups: 37\% of the total pico-PFs and 65\% of the nano-PFs composition. Chlorophytes were mostly picoplanktonic and they never ingested fluorescently labeled bacteria. About 50\% of the PF \&lt;20 μm biomass was represented by mixotrophic algae. Pigmented dinoflagellates were the least abundant group with little impact on bacterioplankton. Cryptophytes were quantitatively important during the coldest periods and explained about 4\% of total bacterivory. Haptophytes were the most important mixotrophic group: (i) they were mostly represented by cells 3–5 μm in size present year-round; (ii) cell-specific grazing rates were comparable to those of other bacterivorous non-photosynthetic organisms, regardless of the in situ nutrient availability conditions; (iii) these organisms could acquire a significant portion of their carbon by ingesting bacteria; and (iv) haptophytes explained on average 40\% of the bacterivory exerted by MFs and were responsible for 9–27\% of total bacterivory at this site. Our results, when considered alongside the widespread distribution of haptophytes in the ocean, indicate that they have a key role as bacterivores in marine ecosystems.},

Time‐course experiments were carried out to quantify primary production, phytoplankton excretion, and the microbial uptake of freshly released dissolved organic carbon (DOC) derived from phytoplankton extracellular release (DOCp) in four large tropical lakes distributed along a productivity gradient: Kivu, Edward, Albert, and Victoria. The contributions of the major heterotrophic bacterial groups to the uptake of DOCp was also analyzed in Lake Kivu, using microautoradiography coupled to catalyzed reporter deposition fluorescent in situ hybridization. The percentage of extracellular release (PER) varied across the productivity gradient, with higher values at low productivity. Furthermore, PER was significantly related to high light and low phosphate concentrations in the mixed layer and was comparatively higher in oligotrophic tropical lakes than in their temperate counterparts. Both observations suggest that environmental factors play a key role in the control of phytoplankton excretion. Standing stocks of DOCp were small and generally contributed less than 1\% to the total DOC because it was rapidly assimilated by prokaryotes. In other words, there was a tight coupling between the production and the heterotrophic consumption of DOCp. None of the major phylogenetic bacterial groups that were investigated differed in their ability to take up DOCp, in contrast with earlier results reported for standard labeled single‐molecule substrates (leucine, glucose, adenosine triphosphate). It supports the idea that the metabolic ability to use DOCp is widespread among heterotrophic prokaryotes. Overall, these results highlight the importance of carbon transfer between phytoplankton and bacterioplankton in large African lakes.},

            The MAST-4 (marine stramenopile group 4) is a widespread uncultured picoeukaryote that makes up an important fraction of marine heterotrophic flagellates. This group has low genetic divergence and is composed of a small number of putative species. We combined ARISA (automated ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis) and ITS (Internal Transcribed Spacer) clone libraries to study the biogeography of this marine protist, examining both spatial and temporal trends in MAST-4 assemblages and associated environmental factors. The most represented MAST-4 clades appeared adapted to different temperature ranges, and their distributions did not suggest clear geographical barriers for dispersal. Distant samples sharing the same temperature had very similar assemblages, especially in cold temperatures, where only one clade, E1, dominated. The most highly represented clades, A and E1, showed very little differentiation between populations from distant geographical regions. Within a single site, temporal variation also followed patterns governed by temperature. Our results contribute to the general discussion on microbial biogeography by showing strong environmental selection for some picoeukaryotes in the marine environment.},

              Dimethylsulfide (DMS) is a biogenic gas with potential climatic effects, and its marine emission depends on the interplay between microbial activity and physical forcing in the oceanic upper mixed layer. We investigated the diel cycling patterns of DMS and its precursor dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) in four experiments (28 to 48 h long) performed in mesotrophic to ultraoligotrophic Mediterranean and Sargasso Sea waters. Samples taken every 4 or 6 h were analyzed for dimethylated sulfur pools and incubated to measure DMS and DMSP cycling rates, as well as primary and bacterial production. In all four experiments, DMS budgets showed pronounced day versus night variability. In the three summer experiments, gross community DMS production (GP
              DMS
              ) increased by twofold to threefold from nighttime to daytime, peaking 0–4 h after solar noon. This excess GP
              DMS
              was balanced by higher photochemical and microbial sinks during the day, effectively buffering DMS concentrations. In the only winter experiment, GP
              DMS
              exhibited opposed temporal dynamics and peaked at nighttime in parallel to total DMSP consumption. Community DMSP to DMS conversion yields were generally {\textless}10\% throughout the winter experiment and at night in summer, and increased to {\textgreater}15\% (even {\textgreater}50\%) during the day in summer, presumably due to phytoplankton radiative stress. Our data suggest that (1) diel variability should be taken into account in process studies, diagnostic, and prognostic models of DMS cycling and (2) the community DMS yield is a key variable that defines characteristic DMS cycling regimes.

Microbial plankton experience short-term fluctuations in total solar irradiance and in its spectral composition as they are vertically moved by turbulence in the oceanic upper mixed layer (UML). The fact that the light exposure is not static but dynamic may have important consequences for biogeochemical processes and ocean–atmosphere fluxes. However, most biogeochemical processes other than primary production, like bacterial production or dimethylsulfide (DMS) production, are seldom measured in sunlight and even less often in dynamic light fields. We conducted four experiments in oligotrophic summer stratified Mediterranean waters, where a sample from the UML was incubated in ultraviolet (UV)-transparent bottles at three fixed depths within the UML and on a vertically moving basket across the same depth range. We assessed the response of the phyto- and bacterioplankton community with physiological indicators based on flow cytometry singe-cell measurements, fast repetition rate fluorometry (FRRf), phytoplankton pigment concentrations and particulate light absorption. Dynamic light exposure caused a subtle disruption of the photoinhibition and photoacclimation processes associated with ultraviolet radiation (UVR), which slightly alleviated bacterial photoinhibition but did not favor primary production. Gross DMS production (GPDMS) decreased sharply with depth in parallel to shortwave UVR, and displayed a dose-dependent response that mixing did not significantly disrupt. To our knowledge, we provide the first measurements of GPDMS under in situ UV-inclusive optical conditions.},

            Marine microorganisms contribute markedly to global biomass and ecosystem function. They include a diverse collection of organisms differing in cell size and in evolutionary history. In particular, microbes within the picoplankton are similar in size but belong to two drastically different cellular plans, the prokaryotes and the eukaryotes. Compared with larger organisms, prokaryotes and picoeukaryotes share ecological features, such as high specific activity, large and constant abundances, and high dispersal potential. Still, there are some aspects where their different cell organization influences their ecological performance. First, prokaryotes have a huge metabolic versatility and are involved in all biogeochemical cycles, whereas picoeukaryotes are metabolically less flexible but can exploit diverse predatory life strategies due to their phagocytic capacity. Second, sexual reproduction is absent in prokaryotes but may be present in picoeukaryotes, thus determining different evolutionary diversification dynamics and making species limits clearer in picoeukaryotes. Finally, it is plausible that picoeukaryotes are less flexible to enter a reversible state of low metabolic activity, thus picoeukaryote assemblages may have fewer rare species and may be less resilient to environmental change. In summary, lumping together pico‐sized microbes may be convenient for some ecological studies, but it is also important to keep in mind their differences.},

            Nucleo-cytoplasmic large DNA viruses (NCLDVs) constitute a group of eukaryotic viruses that can have crucial ecological roles in the sea by accelerating the turnover of their unicellular hosts or by causing diseases in animals. To better characterize the diversity, abundance and biogeography of marine NCLDVs, we analyzed 17 metagenomes derived from microbial samples (0.2–1.6 μm size range) collected during the Tara Oceans Expedition. The sample set includes ecosystems under-represented in previous studies, such as the Arabian Sea oxygen minimum zone (OMZ) and Indian Ocean lagoons. By combining computationally derived relative abundance and direct prokaryote cell counts, the abundance of NCLDVs was found to be in the order of 104–105 genomes ml−1 for the samples from the photic zone and 102–103 genomes ml−1 for the OMZ. The Megaviridae and Phycodnaviridae dominated the NCLDV populations in the metagenomes, although most of the reads classified in these families showed large divergence from known viral genomes. Our taxon co-occurrence analysis revealed a potential association between viruses of the Megaviridae family and eukaryotes related to oomycetes. In support of this predicted association, we identified six cases of lateral gene transfer between Megaviridae and oomycetes. Our results suggest that marine NCLDVs probably outnumber eukaryotic organisms in the photic layer (per given water mass) and that metagenomic sequence analyses promise to shed new light on the biodiversity of marine viruses and their interactions with potential hosts.},

            The heterotrophic bacterial community of the Eastern Mediterranean Sea is believed to be limited by phosphorus (P) availability. This observation assumes that all bacterial groups are equally limited, something that has not been hitherto examined. To test this hypothesis, we performed nutrient addition experiments and investigated the response of probe-identified groups using microautoradiography combined with catalyzed reporter deposition fluorescence in situ hybridization. Our results show contrasting responses between the bacterial groups, with Gammaproteobacteria being the group more affected by P availability. The Roseobacter clade was likely colimited by P and nitrogen (N), whereas Bacteroidetes by P, N and organic carbon (C). In contrast, SAR11 cells were active regardless of the nutrient concentration. These results indicate that there is high heterogeneity in the nutrient limitation of the different components of the bacterioplankton community.},

Both phytoplankton and bacterioplankton assimilate and release DFAA, but their consumption and production are difficult to quantify in nature due to their short residence times (min) as dissolved monomers. We segregated DFAA production by phytoplankton and bacterial consumption by measuring individual DFAA concentrations in four axenic phytoplankton cultures during the exponential growth phase, and also after 4 d incubations in the presence of a natural bacterioplankton community. The amounts and composition of the DFAA pool varied widely among phytoplankton species. The proportion of dissolved organic carbon attributed to DFAA varied among cultures. The picoeukaryotic prasinophyte,
              Micromonas pusilla,

	abstract = {Planktonic bacteria dominate surface ocean biomass and influence global biogeochemical processes, but remain poorly characterized owing to difficulties in cultivation. Using large-scale single cell genomics, we obtained insight into the genome content and biogeography of many bacterial lineages inhabiting the surface ocean. We found that, compared with existing cultures, natural bacterioplankton have smaller genomes, fewer gene duplications, and are depleted in guanine and cytosine, noncoding nucleotides, and genes encoding transcription, signal transduction, and noncytoplasmic proteins. These findings provide strong evidence that genome streamlining and oligotrophy are prevalent features among diverse, free-living bacterioplankton, whereas existing laboratory cultures consist primarily of copiotrophs. The apparent ubiquity of metabolic specialization and mixotrophy, as predicted from single cell genomes, also may contribute to the difficulty in bacterioplankton cultivation. Using metagenome fragment recruitment against single cell genomes, we show that the global distribution of surface ocean bacterioplankton correlates with temperature and latitude and is not limited by dispersal at the time scales required for nucleotide substitution to exceed the current operational definition of bacterial species. Single cell genomes with highly similar small subunit rRNA gene sequences exhibited significant genomic and biogeographic variability, highlighting challenges in the interpretation of individual gene surveys and metagenome assemblies in environmental microbiology. Our study demonstrates the utility of single cell genomics for gaining an improved understanding of the composition and dynamics of natural microbial assemblages.},

Experimentally determined net community DMS production, DMS photolysis, and dark microbial DMS consumption rates were used to calculate gross community DMS production by budgeting. In addition, the composition of the bacterioplankton and phytoplankton communities in the initial samples, and the photoinhibition of bulk bacterial heterotrophic activity and phytoplankton photosynthetic efficiency were monitored. Our results show that: (1) gross DMS production is irradiance dependent, with a maximum short‐term stimulation factor of 2‐ to 6‐fold compared to dark incubations; (2) its spectral shape is variable but generally similar to that of phytoplankton photoinhibition or photodamage, with more effective stimulation at shorter ultraviolet wavelengths; and (3) stronger stimulation occurs when samples are overexposed with respect to their prior exposure. Remarkably, the photoresponse of gross DMS production was in most cases strong enough to (at least) compensate the photochemical DMS loss at the water subsurface. Such response would prevent DMS depletion in stratified and highly irradiated waters. Since the initial microbial communities were representative of meso‐ to oligotrophic conditions, our observations should apply to a wide variety of oceanic regimes.},

            Protists (unicellular eukaryotes) arguably account for most eukaryotic diversity and are central players of the biosphere. Known protist diversity and biology is largely based on cultured strains. Yet, environmental molecular surveys have unveiled entirely novel lineages that, as their prokaryotic counterparts, are essentially uncultured. Culture bias is an important drawback for any microbe-related science and is particularly severe for heterotrophic protists, which depend on organic food sources for growth. Here, we show how ecologically significant bacterivorous protists have been brought into culture by mimicking in situ conditions. Single cells sorted by serial dilution or flow cytometry were inoculated into seawater amended with natural bacterial assemblage at nearly in situ abundances. Strains belonging to lineages only known so far from environmental sequencing were isolated. Among them, Minorisa minuta gen. nov. sp. nov. forms a novel branch within Rhizaria, holding a key evolutionary position, and with an average size of 1.4 μm represents one of the smallest bacterial grazers known to date. It has a worldwide planktonic distribution and can account for 5\% of heterotrophic protists communities in coastal waters. Physiological features of this strain can partly explain its success in the environment. Culturing ecologically relevant but elusive protists provide invaluable material for ecophysiology, genomics, ecosystem modeling and evolutionary issues.},

              3
              H‐leucine were exposed to solar radiation under three radiation treatments: PAR + UVR (280–700 nm), PAR + UVA (320–700 nm), and PAR only. Parallel reference incubations in the dark and under a fixed artificial light source (PAR only) were also performed. Exposure to high UVR doses caused strong inhibition of

              H‐leucine incorporation rates (LIR), whereas natural PAR doses did not cause overall significant effects. Within UVR, UVA radiation accounted for most of the reduction in LIR, and this effect was modulated by the proportionality of the experimental light to the previous light exposure history of the samples. Constant (artificial) PAR‐only exposure led to a general but seasonally variable increase in bacterial heterotrophic production compared to the dark controls, with large increases in spring and lower changes during summer. This pattern was likely caused by the stimulation of the bacterial group

              Although the rapid recovery of fishes after establishment of a marine reserve is well known, much less is known about the response of long‐lived, sessile, benthic organisms to establishment of such reserves. Since antiquity, Mediterranean red coral (Corallium rubrum) has been harvested intensively for use in jewelry, and its distribution is currently smaller than its historical size throughout the Mediterranean Sea. To assess whether establishment of marine reserves is associated with a change in the size and number of red coral colonies that historically were not harvested sustainably, we analyzed temporal changes in mean colony diameter and density from 1992 to 2005 within red coral populations at different study sites in the Medes Islands Marine Reserve (established in 1992) and in adjacent unprotected areas. Moreover, we compared colony size in the Medes Islands Marine Reserve, where recreational diving is allowed and poaching has been observed after reserve establishment, with colony size in three other marine protected areas (Banyuls, Carry‐le‐Rouet, and Scandola) with the enforced prohibition of fishing and diving. At the end of the study, the size of red coral colonies at all sampling sites in the Medes Islands was significantly smaller than predicted by growth models and smaller than those in marine protected areas without fishing and diving. The annual number of recreational dives and the percent change in the basal diameter of red coral colonies were negatively correlated, which suggests that abrasion by divers may increase the mortality rates of the largest red coral colonies within this reserve
              . Our study is the first quantitative assessment of a poaching event, which was detected during our monitoring in 2002, inside the marine reserve. Poaching was associated with a loss of approximately 60\% of the biomass of red coral colonies.

                Resumen: 
                Aunque la rápida recuperación de peces después del establecimiento de una reserva marina es bien conocida, se sabe mucho menos sobre la respuesta de organismos bénticos, sésiles y longevos al establecimiento de tales reservas. Desde la antigüedad, el coral rojo del Mediterráneo (Corallium rubrum) ha sido recolectado intensivamente para su uso en joyería, y su distribución actualmente es más pequeña que su tamaño histórico en el Mar Mediterráneo. Para evaluar si el establecimiento de reservas marinas está asociado con un cambio en el tamaño y número de colonias de coral rojo que históricamente no fueron recolectadas sosteniblemente, analizamos los cambios temporales, de 1992 a 2005, en el diámetro y densidad promedio de las colonias de coral rojo en diferentes sitios de estudio en la Reserva Marina Islas Medes (establecida en 1992) y en áreas no protegidas adyacentes. Más aun, comparamos el tamaño de las colonias en la Reserva Marina Islas Medes, donde se permite el buceo recreativo y se ha observado pesca furtiva después del establecimiento de la reserva, con el tamaño de las colonias en otras tres áreas marinas protegidas (Banyus, Carry‐le‐Rouet y Scandola) con prohibición forzada de pesca y buceo. Al final del estudio, el tamaño de las colonias de coral rojo en todos los sitios de muestreo en la Islas Medes fue significativamente más pequeño que el pronosticado por los modelos de crecimiento y más pequeño que el de las colonias en áreas marinas protegidas sin pesca ni buceo. El número anual de buceos recreativos y el cambio porcentual en el diámetro basal de las colonias de coral rojo se correlacionaron negativamente, lo que sugiere que la abrasión causada por buzos puede incrementar las tasas de mortalidad en esta reserva. Nuestro estudio es la primera evaluación cuantitativa de un evento de pesca furtiva, que fue detectada durante nuestro monitoreo en 2002, en el interior de la reserva marina. La pesca furtiva se asoció con la pérdida de cerca de 60\% de la biomasa de colonias de coral rojo.},

The percentage of SAR11 active cells was relatively high in the upwelling area, particularly for glucose and amino acid uptake (up to 53\% of active cells), which suggests that some members of this group are also adapted to nutrient‐rich environments. Of the broad phylogenetic groups tested, Bacteroidetes were the least active and Alpha‐ and Gammaproteobacteria showed similar percentages of active cells in amino acid uptake (∼ 30\%). Alphaproteobacteria had the highest percent of cells involved in glucose uptake, while Gammaproteobacteria dominated ATP uptake. This general pattern was confirmed in a broader analysis that included data from contrasting marine environments, which suggests that major phylogenetic groups of bacteria participate differently in the turnover of these low‐molecular‐weight organics. Our results support the view that broad phylogenetic groups can be identified within the bacterial ‘black box’ with different patterns in the cycling of organic matter. Analyzing them may help us understand, and ultimately predict, oceanic carbon processing.},

              The use of inorganic phosphate (Pi) and dissolved organic phosphorus (DOP) by different bacterial groups was studied in experimental mesocosms of P‐starved eastern Mediterranean waters in the absence (control mesocosms) and presence of additional Pi (P‐amended mesocosms). The low Pi turnover times in the control mesocosms and the increase in heterotrophic prokaryotic abundance and production upon Pi addition confirmed that the bacterial community was originally P‐limited. The bacterioplankton groups taking up Pi and DOP were identified by means of microautoradiography combined with catalysed reporter deposition fluorescence
              in situ
              hybridization. Incubations with leucine were also performed for comparative purposes. All the probe‐identified groups showed a high percentage of cells taking up Pi and DOP in the control, P‐limited, mesocosms throughout the experiment. However, in response to Pi addition two contrasting scenarios in Pi use were observed: (i) on day 1 of the experiment Pi addition caused a clear reduction in the percentage of SAR11 cells taking up Pi, whereas
              Gammaproteobacteria

These differences are likely related to different P requirements among the bacterial groups and point out to the existence of two contrasting strategies in P use.},

              The ecological significance of the marine bacterial populations distinguishable by flow cytometry on the basis of the fluorescence (FL) of their nucleic acid (NA) content and proxies of cell size (such as side scatter, SSC) remains largely unknown. Some studies have suggested that cells with high NA (HNA) content and high SSC (HS) represent the active members of the community, while the low NA (LNA) cells are inactive members of the same phylogenetic groups. But group‐specific activity measurements and phylogenetic assignment after cell sorting have suggested this is not be the case, particularly in open‐ocean communities. To test the extent to which the different NA subgroups are similar, and consequently the extent to which they likely have similar ecological and biogeochemical roles in the environment, we analysed the phylogenetic composition of three populations after cell sorting [high NA‐high SC (HNA‐HS), high NA‐low SC (HNA‐LS), low NA (LNA)] by 454 pyrosequencing in two contrasting periods of the year in NW Mediterranean coastal waters (BBMO, Blanes Bay Microbial Observatory) where these three populations have recurrent seasonal patterns. Statistical analyses showed that summer and winter samples were significantly different and, importantly, the sorted populations within a sample were composed of different taxa. The majority of taxa were associated with one NA fraction only, and the degree of overlap (i.e. OTUs present simultaneously in 2 fractions) between HNA and LNA and between summer and winter communities was very small.

              Bacteroidetes

              Gammaproteobacteria
              other than SAR86 showed less preference for one particular NA fraction. An increase in diversity was observed from the LNA to the HNA‐HS fraction for both sample dates.

Twice a day, the single‐cell activity of major bacterial groups was further analyzed by applying microautoradiography combined with catalyzed reporter deposition—fluorescence in situ hybridization. During the first cycle, all the measured parameters (including the number of active cells in most groups) varied synchronously, with higher values at night and lower during the day.

            Flagellated heterotrophic microeukaryotes have key roles for the functioning of marine ecosystems as they channel large amounts of organic carbon to the upper trophic levels and control the population sizes of bacteria and archaea. Still, we know very little on the diversity patterns of most groups constituting this evolutionary heterogeneous assemblage. Here, we investigate 11 groups of uncultured flagellates known as MArine STramenopiles (MASTs). MASTs are ecologically very important and branch at the base of stramenopiles. We explored the diversity patterns of MASTs using pyrosequencing (18S rDNA) in coastal European waters. We found that MAST groups range from highly to lowly diversified. Pyrosequencing (hereafter ‘454’) allowed us to approach to the limits of taxonomic diversity for all MAST groups, which varied in one order of magnitude (tens to hundreds) in terms of operational taxonomic units (98\% similarity). We did not evidence large differences in activity, as indicated by ratios of DNA:RNA-reads. Most groups were strictly planktonic, although we found some groups that were active in sediments and even in anoxic waters. The proportion of reads per size fraction indicated that most groups were composed of very small cells (∼2–5 μm). In addition, phylogenetically different assemblages appeared to be present in different size fractions, depths and geographic zones. Thus, MAST diversity seems to be highly partitioned in spatial scales. Altogether, our results shed light on these ecologically very important but poorly known groups of uncultured marine flagellates.},

              Most marine sponges establish a persistent association with a wide array of phylogenetically and physiologically diverse microbes. To date, the role of these symbiotic microbial communities in the metabolism and nutrient cycles of the sponge‐microbe consortium remains largely unknown. We identified and quantified the microbial communities associated with three common Mediterranean sponge species,
              Dysidea avara
              ,
              Agelas oroides
              and
              Chondrosia reniformis
              (
              Demospongiae
              ) that cohabitate coralligenous community. For each sponge we quantified the uptake and release of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and nitrogen (DON), inorganic nitrogen and phosphate. Low microbial abundance and no evidence for DOC uptake or nitrification were found for
              D. avara
              . In contrast
              A. oroides
              and
              C. reniformis
              showed high microbial abundance (30\% and 70\% of their tissue occupied by microbes respectively) and both species exhibited high nitrification and high DOC and NH
              4
              +
              uptake. Surprisingly, these unique metabolic pathways were mediated in each sponge species by a different, and host specific, microbial community. The functional convergence of microbial consortia found in these two sympatric sponge species, suggest that these metabolic processes may be of special relevance to the success of the holobiont.},

            We analyzed the regional distribution of bulk heterotrophic prokaryotic activity (leucine incorporation) and selected single-cell parameters (cell viability and nucleic acid content) as parameters for microbial functioning, as well as bacterial and archaeal community structure in the epipelagic (0 to 200 m) and mesopelagic (200 to 1,000 m) subtropical Northeast Atlantic Ocean. We selectively sampled three contrasting regions covering a wide range of surface productivity and oceanographic properties within the same basin: (i) the eddy field south of the Canary Islands, (ii) the open-ocean NE Atlantic Subtropical Gyre, and (iii) the upwelling filament off Cape Blanc. In the epipelagic waters, a high regional variation in hydrographic parameters and bacterial community structure was detected, accompanied, however, by a low variability in microbial functioning. In contrast, mesopelagic microbial functioning was highly variable between the studied regions despite the homogeneous abiotic conditions found therein. More microbial functioning parameters indicated differences among the three regions within the mesopelagic (i.e., viability of cells, nucleic acid content, cell-specific heterotrophic activity, nanoflagellate abundance, prokaryote-to-nanoflagellate abundance ratio) than within the epipelagic (i.e., bulk activity, nucleic acid content, and nanoflagellate abundance) waters. Our results show that the mesopelagic realm in the Northeast Atlantic is, in terms of microbial activity, more heterogeneous than its epipelagic counterpart, probably linked to mesoscale hydrographical variations.},

              The main role of microorganisms in the cycling of the bulk dissolved organic carbon pool in the ocean is well established. Nevertheless, it remains unclear if particular bacteria preferentially utilize specific carbon compounds and whether such compounds have the potential to shape bacterial community composition. Enrichment experiments in the Mediterranean Sea, Baltic Sea and the North Sea (Skagerrak) showed that different low‐molecular‐weight organic compounds, with a proven importance for the growth of marine bacteria (e.g. amino acids, glucose, dimethylsulphoniopropionate, acetate or pyruvate), in most cases differentially stimulated bacterial growth. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis ‘fingerprints’ and 16S rRNA gene sequencing revealed that some bacterial phylotypes that became abundant were highly specific to enrichment with specific carbon compounds (e.g.
              Acinetobacter
              sp. B1‐A3 with acetate or
              Psychromonas
              sp. B3‐U1 with glucose). In contrast, other phylotypes increased in relative abundance in response to enrichment with several, or all, of the investigated carbon compounds (e.g.
              Neptuniibacter
              sp. M2‐A4 with acetate, pyruvate and dimethylsulphoniopropionate, and
              Thalassobacter
              sp. M3‐A3 with pyruvate and amino acids). Furthermore, different carbon compounds triggered the development of unique combinations of dominant phylotypes in several of the experiments. These results suggest that bacteria differ substantially in their abilities to utilize specific carbon compounds, with some bacteria being specialists and others having a more generalist strategy. Thus, changes in the supply or composition of the dissolved organic carbon pool can act as selective forces structuring bacterioplankton communities.},

	abstract = {Summary
            Phytoplankton and heterotrophic prokaryotes are major components of the microbial food web and interact continuously: heterotrophic prokaryotes utilize the dissolved organic carbon derived from phytoplankton exudation or cell lysis (DOCp), and mineralization by heterotrophic prokaryotes provides inorganic nutrients for phytoplankton. For this reason, these communities are expected to be closely linked, although the study of the interactions between them is still a major challenge. Recent studies have presented interactions between phytoplankton and heterotrophic prokaryotes based on coexistence or covariation throughout a time‐series. However, a real quantification of the carbon flow within these networks (defined as the interaction strength, IS) has not been achieved yet. This is critical to understand the selectivity degree of bacteria responding to specific algal DOCp. Here we used microautoradiography to quantify the preferences of the major heterotrophic prokaryote phylogenetic groups on DOC derived from several representative phytoplankton species, and expressed these preferences as an IS value. The distribution of the ISs was not random but rather skewed towards weak interactions, in a similar way as the distributions described for stable complex non‐microbial ecosystems, indicating that there are some cases of high specificity on the use of specific algal DOCp by some bacterial groups, but weak interactions are more common and may be relevant as well. The variety of IS patterns observed supports the view that the vast range of different resources (different types of organic molecules) available in the sea selects and maintains the high levels of diversity described for marine bacterioplankton.},

The different approaches that we used converged to an average BGE of 13\% ± 1\%, with peaks of over 20\% in the more productive coastal areas and values declining to below 5\% toward the oligotrophic gyre waters. There was overall coherence between the various aspects of bacterial C metabolism: communities with low BGE also tended to have low growth rates and high leucine‐to‐thymidine incorporation ratios. The patterns in BGE were mirrored at the single compound level, and in the most oligotrophic sites, bacteria tended to quickly respire a large fraction (20–75\%) of the leucine that was taken up and had the lowest C‐to‐leucine yield, suggesting that the patterns in bulk BGE and growth also apply to individual substrates. Bacterial growth was a function of both C consumption and BGE; these two aspects of bacterial C metabolism do not necessarily covary, and they are regulated differently. The patterns in C consumption, growth, BGE, and leucine metabolism all reflect the basic physiological response of bacteria to energy limitation due to high maintenance costs associated with life in oligotrophy.},

              Growth is one of the basic attributes of any living organism. Surprisingly, the growth rates of marine bacterioplankton are only poorly known. Current data suggest that marine bacteria grow relatively slowly, having generation times of several days. However, some bacterial groups, such as the aerobic anoxygenic phototrophic (AAP) bacteria, have been shown to grow much faster. Two manipulation experiments, in which grazing, viruses, and resource competition were reduced, were conducted in the coastal Mediterranean Sea (Blanes Bay Microbial Observatory). The growth rates of AAP bacteria and of several important phylogenetic groups (the
              Bacteroidetes
              , the alphaproteobacterial groups
              Roseobacter
              and SAR11, and the
              Gammaproteobacteria
              group and its subgroups the
              Alteromonadaceae
              and the NOR5/OM60 clade) were calculated from changes in cell numbers in the manipulation treatments. In addition, we examined the role that top-down (mortality due to grazers and viruses) and bottom-up (resource availability) factors play in determining the growth rates of these groups. Manipulations resulted in an increase of the growth rates of all groups studied, but its extent differed largely among the individual treatments and among the different groups. Interestingly, higher growth rates were found for the AAP bacteria (up to 3.71 day
              −1
              ) and for the
              Alteromonadaceae
              (up to 5.44 day
              −1
              ), in spite of the fact that these bacterial groups represented only a very low percentage of the total prokaryotic community. In contrast, the SAR11 clade, which was the most abundant group, was the slower grower in all treatments. Our results show that, in general, the least abundant groups exhibited the highest rates, whereas the most abundant groups were those growing more slowly, indicating that some minor groups, such the AAP bacteria, very likely contribute much more to the recycling of organic matter in the ocean than what their abundances alone would predict.},

              The distribution of aerobic anoxygenic phototrophs (AAPs) was surveyed in various regions of the Mediterranean Sea in spring and summer.

	abstract = {Summary
            
              The prokaryotic community composition of activated sludge from a seawater‐processing wastewater treatment plant (Almeria, Spain) was investigated by using the rRNA approach, combining different molecular techniques such as denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), clone libraries and
              in situ
              hybridization (FISH and CARD‐FISH). Most of the sequences retrieved in the DGGE and the clone libraries were similar to uncultured members of different phyla. The most abundant sequence recovered from Bacteria in the clone library corresponded to a bacterium from the
              Deinococcus–Thermus
              cluster (almost 77\% of the clones), and the library included members from other groups such as the
              Alpha, Gamma
              and
              Delta
              subclasses of
              Proteobacteria
              , the
              Bacteroidetes
              and
              Firmicutes
              . Concerning the archaeal clone library, we basically found sequences related to different orders of methanogenic
              Archaea
              , in correspondence with the recovered DGGE bands. Enumeration of DAPI (4′,6‐diamidino‐2‐phenylindole) stained cells from two different activated sludge samples after a mechanical flocculation disruption revealed a mean cell count of 1.6 × 10
              9
               ml
              −1
              . Around 94\% of DAPI counts (mean value from both samples) hybridized with a
              Bacteria
              specific probe.
              Alphaproteobacteria
              were the dominant bacterial group (36\% of DAPI counts), while
              Beta
              ‐,
              Delta
              ‐ and
              Gammaproteobacteria
              ,
              Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria
              and
              Firmicutes
              contributed to lower proportions (between 0.5–5.7\% of DAPI counts).
              Archaea
              accounted only for 6\% of DAPI counts. In addition, specific primers for amplification of the
              amoA
              (ammonia monooxygenase) gene were used to detect the presence of
              Beta
              ,
              Gamma
              and archaeal nitrifiers, yielding positive amplifications only for
              Betaproteobacteria
              . This, together with negative
              in situ
              hybridizations with probes for well‐known nitrifiying bacteria, suggests that nitrification is performed by still undetected microorganisms. In summary, the combination of the three approaches provided different and complementary pictures of the real assemblage composition and allowed to get closer to the main microorganisms involved in key processes of seawater‐processing activated sludge.},

              An understanding of the distribution of colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) in the oceans and its role in the global carbon cycle requires a better knowledge of the colored materials produced and consumed by marine phytoplankton and bacteria. In this work, we examined the net uptake and release of CDOM by a natural bacterial community growing on DOM derived from four phytoplankton species cultured under axenic conditions. Fluorescent humic-like substances exuded by phytoplankton (excitation/emission [Ex/Em] wavelength, 310 nm/392 nm; Coble's peak M) were utilized by bacteria in different proportions depending on the phytoplankton species of origin. Furthermore, bacteria produced humic-like substances that fluoresce at an Ex/Em wavelength of 340 nm/440 nm (Coble's peak C). Differences were also observed in the Ex/Em wavelengths of the protein-like materials (Coble's peak T) produced by phytoplankton and bacteria. The induced fluorescent emission of CDOM produced by prokaryotes was an order of magnitude higher than that of CDOM produced by eukaryotes. We have also examined the final compositions of the bacterial communities growing on the exudates, which differed markedly depending on the phytoplankton species of origin.
              Alteromonas
              and
              Roseobacter
              were dominant during all the incubations on

              Alteromonas
              was the dominant group growing on
              Skeletonema costatum
              exudates during the exponential growth phase, but it was replaced by
              Roseobacter

              was replaced by
              Bacteroidetes
              after the exponential growth phase. Our work shows that fluorescence excitation-emission matrices of CDOM can be a helpful tool for the identification of microbial sources of DOM in the marine environment, but further studies are necessary to explore the association of particular bacterial groups with specific fluorophores.},

We tested extensively the method and its limitations using a wide range of sample types and trying several fixation and conservation alternatives.

FC and epifluorescence microscopy (EpiM) were in good agreement and FC yielded lower variability between replicate samples than EpiM. One limitation we encountered was that, in the presence of large bacteria and/or bacterial aggregates, enumeration was difficult. However, in absence of bacterial aggregates samples with Bact/HF ratios {\textgreater} 1000, HF could be well‐enumerated.},

            Microbes play key roles in the functioning of the biosphere. Still, our knowledge about their total diversity is very limited. In particular, we lack a clear understanding of the evolutionary dynamics occurring within their populations (i.e. among members of the same biological species). Unlike animals and plants, microbes normally have huge population sizes, high reproductive rates and the potential for unrestricted dispersal. As a consequence, the knowledge of population genetics acquired from studying animals and plants cannot be applied without extensive testing to microbes. Next generation molecular tools, like High Throughput Sequencing (e.g. 454 and Illumina) coupled to Single Cell Genomics, now allow investigating microbial populations at a very fine scale. Such techniques have the potential to shed light on several ecological and evolutionary processes occurring within microbial populations that so far have remained hidden. Furthermore, they may facilitate the identification of microbial species. Eventually, we may find an answer to the question of whether microbes and multicellular organisms follow the same or different rules in their population diversification patterns.},

            Despite the ecological importance of marine pico-size eukaryotes, the study of their in situ diversity using molecular tools started just a few years ago. These studies have revealed that marine picoeukaryotes are very diverse and include many novel taxa. However, the amount and structure of their phylogenetic diversity and the extent of their sequence novelty still remains poorly known, as a systematic analysis has been seldom attempted. In this study, we use a coherent and carefully curated data set of 500 published 18S ribosomal DNA sequences to quantify the diversity and novelty patterns of picoeukaryotes in the Indian Ocean. Our phylogenetic tree showed many distant lineages. We grouped sequences in OTUs (operational taxonomic units) at discrete values delineated by pair-wise Jukes–Cantor (JC) distances and tree patristic distances. At a distance of 0.01, the number of OTUs observed (237/242; using JC or patristic distances, respectively) was half the number of sequences analyzed, indicating the existence of microdiverse clusters of highly related sequences. At this distance level, we estimated 600–800 OTUs using several statistical methods. The number of OTUs observed was still substantial at higher distances (39/82 at 0.20 distance) suggesting a large diversity at high-taxonomic ranks. Most sequences were related to marine clones from other sites and many were distant to cultured organisms, highlighting the huge culturing gap within protists. The novelty analysis indicated the putative presence of pseudogenes and of truly novel high-rank phylogenetic lineages. The identified diversity and novelty patterns among marine picoeukaryotes are of great importance for understanding and interpreting their ecology and evolution.},

              The Senegalese sole (
              Solea senegalensis
              ) is a marine flatfish of high economic value and a target species for aquaculture. The efforts to reproduce this species in captivity have been hampered by the fact that farmed males (F1) often show lower sperm production and fertilization capacity than wild‐type males (F0). Our knowledge on spermatogenesis is however limited to a few studies. In a previous work, we identified by 2‐D DIGE several potential protein markers in testis for the poor reproductive performance of F1 males. Therefore, the objectives of the present study were, first, to investigate changes in genes and proteins expressed in the testis throughout spermatogenesis in F0 males by using a combination of transcriptomic and proteomic approaches and, second, to further compare the testis proteome between late spermatogenic stages of F0 and F1 fish to identify potential indicators of hampered reproductive performance in F1 fish. We identified approximately 400 genes and 49 proteins that are differentially expressed during the progression of spermatogenesis and that participate in processes such as transcriptional activation, the ubiquitin–proteasome system, sperm maturation and motility or cytoskeletal remodeling. Interestingly, a number of these proteins differed in abundance between F0 and F1 fish, pointing toward alterations in cytoskeleton, sperm motility, the ubiquitin–proteasome system and the redox state during spermiogenesis as possible causes for the decreased fertility of F1 fish.},

              The suitability of applying empirical conversion factors (eCFs) to determine bacterial biomass production remains unclear because seawater cultures are usually overtaken by phylotypes that are not abundant
              in situ
              . While eCFs vary across environments, it has not been tested whether differences in eCFs are driven by changes in bacterial community composition or by
              in situ
              environmental conditions. We carried out seawater cultures throughout a year to analyse the correlation between eCFs and bacterial community structure, analysed by catalysed reporter deposition fluorescence
              in situ
              hybridization.
              Gammaproteobacteria
              usually dominated seawater cultures, but their abundance exhibited a wide range (25–73\% of cell counts) and significantly increased with inorganic nutrient enrichment.
              Flavobacteria
              were less abundant but increased up to 40\% of cells counts in winter seawater cultures, when
              in situ
              chlorophyll a was high. The correlations between eCFs and the abundance of the main broad phylogenetic groups (
              Gamma‐, Alphaproteobacteria
              and
              Flavobacteria
              ) were significant, albeit weak, while more specific groups (
              Alteromonadaceae
              and
              Rhodobacteraceae
              ) were not significantly correlated. Our results show that the frequent development of the fast‐growing group
              Alteromonadaceae
              in seawater cultures does not strongly drive the observed variations in eCFs. Rather, the results imply that environmental conditions and the growth of specific phylotypes interact to determine eCFs.},

            To investigate the effects of mesoscale eddies on prokaryotic assemblage structure and activity, we sampled two cyclonic eddies (CEs) and two anticyclonic eddies (AEs) in the permanent eddy-field downstream the Canary Islands. The eddy stations were compared with two far-field (FF) stations located also in the Canary Current, but outside the influence of the eddy field. The distribution of prokaryotic abundance (PA), bulk prokaryotic heterotrophic activity (PHA), various indicators of single-cell activity (such as nucleic acid content, proportion of live cells, and fraction of cells actively incorporating leucine), as well as bacterial and archaeal community structure were determined from the surface to 2000 m depth. In the upper epipelagic layer (0–200 m), the effect of eddies on the prokaryotic community was more apparent, as indicated by the higher PA, PHA, fraction of living cells, and percentage of active cells incorporating leucine within eddies than at FF stations. Prokaryotic community composition differed also between eddy and FF stations in the epipelagic layer. In the mesopelagic layer (200–1000 m), there were also significant differences in PA and PHA between eddy and FF stations, although in general, there were no clear differences in community composition or single-cell activity. The effects on prokaryotic activity and community structure were stronger in AE than CE, decreasing with depth in both types of eddies. Overall, both types of eddies show distinct community compositions (as compared with FF in the epipelagic), and represent oceanic ‘hotspots’ of prokaryotic activity (in the epi- and mesopelagic realms).},

	abstract = {Abstract. We present an overview of the plankton studies conducted during the last 25 years in the epipelagic offshore waters of the Mediterranean Sea. This quasi-enclosed sea is characterized by a rich and complex physical dynamics with distinctive traits, especially in regard to the thermohaline circulation. Recent investigations have basically confirmed the long-recognised oligotrophic nature of this sea, which increases along both the west-east and the north-south directions. Nutrient availability is low, especially for phosphorous (N:P up to 60), though this limitation may be buffered by inputs from highly populated coasts and from the atmosphere. Phytoplankton biomass, as chl a, generally displays low values (less than 0.2 μg chl a l−1) over large areas, with a modest late winter increase. A large bloom (up to 3 μg l−1) is observed throughout the late winter and spring exclusively in the NW area. Relatively high biomass values are recorded in fronts and cyclonic gyres. A deep chlorophyll maximum is a permanent feature for the whole basin, except during the late winter mixing. It is found at increasingly greater depths ranging from 30 m in the Alboran Sea to 120 m in the easternmost Levantine basin. Primary production reveals a west-east decreasing trend and ranges between 59 and 150 g C m−2 y−1 (in situ measurements). Overall, the basin is largely dominated by small autotrophs, microheterotrophs and egg-carrying copepod species. The microorganisms (phytoplankton, viruses, bacteria, flagellates and ciliates) and zooplankton components reveal a considerable diversity and variability over spatial and temporal scales, although the latter is poorly studied. Examples are the wide diversity of dinoflagellates and coccolithophores, the multifarious role of diatoms or picoeukaryotes, and the distinct seasonal or spatial patterns of the species-rich copepod genera or families which dominate the basin. Major dissimilarities between western and eastern basins have been highlighted in species composition of phytoplankton and mesozooplankton, but also in the heterotrophic microbial components and in their relationships. Superimposed to these longitudinal differences, a pronounced biological heterogeneity is also observed in areas hosting deep convection, fronts, cyclonic and anti-cyclonic gyres or eddies. In such areas, the intermittent nutrient enrichment promotes a switching between a small-sized microbial community and diatom-dominated populations. A classical food web readily substitutes the microbial food web in these cases. These switches, likely occurring within a continuum of trophic pathways, may greatly increase the flux towards higher trophic levels, in spite of the apparent heterotrophy. Basically, the microbial system seems to be both bottom-up and top-down controlled. A "multivorous web" is shown by the great variety of feeding modes and preferences and by the significant and simultaneous grazing impact on phytoplankton and ciliates by mesozooplankton.},

	abstract = {It is generally assumed that sinking particulate organic carbon (POC) constitutes the main source of organic carbon supply to the deep ocean's food webs. However, a major discrepancy between the rates of sinking POC supply (collected with sediment traps) and the prokaryotic organic carbon demand (the total amount of carbon required to sustain the heterotrophic metabolism of the prokaryotes; i.e., production plus respiration, PCD) of deep‐water communities has been consistently reported for the dark realm of the global ocean. While the amount of sinking POC flux declines exponentially with depth, the concentration of suspended, buoyant non‐sinking POC (nsPOC; obtained with oceanographic bottles) exhibits only small variations with depth in the (sub)tropical Northeast Atlantic. Based on available data for the North Atlantic we show here that the sinking POC flux would contribute only 4–12\% of the PCD in the mesopelagic realm (depending on the primary production rate in surface waters). The amount of nsPOC potentially available to heterotrophic prokaryotes in the mesopelagic realm can be partly replenished by dark dissolved inorganic carbon fixation contributing between 12\% to 72\% to the PCD daily. Taken together, there is evidence that the mesopelagic microheterotrophic biota is more dependent on the nsPOC pool than on the sinking POC supply. Hence, the enigmatic major mismatch between the organic carbon demand of the deep‐water heterotrophic microbiota and the POC supply rates might be substantially smaller by including the potentially available nsPOC and its autochthonous production in oceanic carbon cycling models.},

	abstract = {Previsions of a warmer ocean as a consequence of climatic change point to a 2–6°C temperature rise during this century in surface oceanic waters. Heterotrophic bacteria occupy the central position of the marine microbial food web, and their metabolic activity and interactions with other compartments within the web are regulated by temperature. In particular, key ecosystem processes like bacterial production (BP), respiration (BR), growth efficiency and bacterial–grazer trophic interactions are likely to change in a warmer ocean. Different approaches can be used to predict these changes. Here we combine evidence of the effects of temperature on these processes and interactions coming from laboratory experiments, space-for-time substitutions, long-term data from microbial observatories and theoretical predictions. Some of the evidence we gathered shows opposite trends to warming depending on the spatio-temporal scale of observation, and the complexity of the system under study. In particular, we show that warming (i) increases BR, (ii) increases bacterial losses to their grazers, and thus bacterial–grazer biomass flux within the microbial food web, (iii) increases BP if enough resources are available (as labile organic matter derived from phytoplankton excretion or lysis), and (iv) increases bacterial losses to grazing at lower rates than BP, and hence decreasing the proportion of production removed by grazers. As a consequence, bacterial abundance would also increase and reinforce the already dominant role of microbes in the carbon cycle of a warmer ocean.},

              The impact of viruses and protists on bacterioplankton mortality was examined monthly during 2 years (May 2005–April 2007) in an oligotrophic coastal environment (NW Mediterranean Sea). We expected that in such type of system, (i) bacterial losses would be caused mainly by protists, and (ii) lysogeny would be an important type of virus–host interaction. During the study period, viruses and grazers together were responsible for 50.6 ± 40.1\% day
              −1
              of bacterial standing stock losses (BSS) and 59.7 ± 44.0\% day
              −1
              of bacterial production losses (BP). Over the first year (May 2005–April 2006), protists were the principal cause of bacterial mortality, removing 29.9 ± 20.4\% day
              −1
              of BSS and 33.9 ± 24.3\% day
              −1
              of BP, whereas viral lysis removed 13.5 ± 17.0\% day
              −1
              of BSS and 12.3 ± 12.3\% day
              −1
              of BP. During the second year (May 2006–April 2007), viruses caused comparable bacterial losses (29.2 ± 14.8\% day
              −1
              of BSS and 40.9 ± 20.7\% day
              −1
              of BP) to protists (28.6 ± 25.5\% day
              −1
              of BSS and 32.4 ± 20.0\% day
              −1
              of BP). In 37\% of cases higher losses of BP due to viruses than due to protists were found. Lysogenic infection was detected in 11 of 24 samplings. Contrary to our expectations, lytic infections dominated over the two years, and viruses resulted to be a significant source of bacterial mortality in this oligotrophic site.},

              Molecular surveys of marine picoeukaryotes have revealed a large number of sequences unrelated to cultured organisms, such as those forming the marine stramenopile (MAST)‐4 clade. Recent FISH (fluorescent
              in situ
              hybridization) data have shown that MAST‐4 cells are uncultured heterotrophic flagellates of 2–3 μm in size that have a global distribution in non‐polar marine waters. However, FISH is time‐consuming and hard to apply to the many samples generated during oceanographic cruises, so we developed a real‐time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (Q‐PCR) protocol to determine rapidly the abundance of this group using environmental DNA. We designed a primer set targeting the 18S rRNA genes (rDNA) of MAST‐4 and optimized and calibrated the Q‐PCR protocol using a plasmid with the target sequence as insert. The Q‐PCR was then applied to quantify MAST‐4 rDNA molecules along three marine transects, longitudinal in the Indian Ocean, latitudinal in the Drake Passage and coastal–offshore in the Mediterranean Sea, and to a temporal study in a Mediterranean Sea coastal station. MAST‐4 was detected in all samples processed (averaged abundances between 500 and 1000 rDNA molecules ml
              −1
              ) except in mesopelagic and Antarctic samples, where it was virtually absent. In general, it was more abundant in the coast than offshore and in the deep chlorophyll maximum than at surface. A comparison of Q‐PCR and FISH signals in well‐controlled microbial incubations indicated that MAST‐4 cells have around 30 copies of the rDNA operon. This Q‐PCR assay quickly yielded quantitative data of uncultured MAST‐4 cells and confirmed their wide distribution and putative ecological importance.},

            Aquatic assemblages of heterotrophic protists are very diverse and formed primarily by organisms that remain uncultured. Thus, a critical issue is assigning a functional role to this unknown biota. Here we measured grazing rates of uncultured protists in natural assemblages (detected by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH)), and investigated their prey preference over several bacterial tracers in short-term ingestion experiments. These included fluorescently labeled bacteria (FLB) and two strains of the Roseobacter lineage and the family Flavobacteriaceae, of various cell sizes, which were offered alive and detected by catalyzed reporter deposition-FISH after the ingestion. We obtained grazing rates of the globally distributed and uncultured marine stramenopiles groups 4 and 1 (MAST-4 and MAST-1C) flagellates. Using FLB, the grazing rate of MAST-4 was somewhat lower than whole community rates, consistent with its small size. MAST-4 preferred live bacteria, and clearance rates with these tracers were up to 2 nl per predator per h. On the other hand, grazing rates of MAST-1C differed strongly depending on the tracer prey used, and these differences could not be explained by cell viability. Highest rates were obtained using FLB whereas the flavobacteria strain was hardly ingested. Possible explanations would be that the small flavobacteria cells were outside the effective size range of edible prey, or that MAST-1C selects against this particular strain. Our original dual FISH protocol applied to grazing experiments reveals important functional differences between distinct uncultured protists and offers the possibility to disentangle the complexity of microbial food webs.},

Genomic approaches continue to uncover the enormous and dynamic genetic variability at phylogenetic and functional levels. Deep‐sea prokaryotes have comparable or even higher cell‐specific extracellular enzymatic activity than do microbes in surface waters, with a high fraction of freely released exoenzymes, probably indicative of a life mode reliant on surface attachment to particles or colloids.

However, knowledge of deep‐ocean food webs is still rudimentary. Dynamics of particle transformation and fate of the exported material in deep waters are still largely unknown. Discrepancies exist between estimates of carbon fluxes and remineralization rates. Recent assessments, however, suggest that integrated respiration in the dark ocean's water column is comparable to that in the epipelagic zone, and that the dark ocean is a site of paramount importance for material cycling in the biosphere. The advent of new molecular tools and in situ sampling methodologies will improve knowledge of the dark ocean's microbial ecosystem and resolve current discrepancies between carbon sources and metabolic requirements of deep‐sea microbes.},

            Pseudanabaena species are poorly known filamentous bloom-forming cyanobacteria closely related to Limnothrix. We isolated 28 Pseudanabaena strains from the Baltic Sea (BS) and the Albufera de Valencia (AV; Spain). By combining phenotypic and genotypic approaches, the phylogeny, diversity and evolutionary diversification of these isolates were explored. Analysis of the in vivo absorption spectra of the Pseudanabaena strains revealed two coexisting pigmentation phenotypes: (i) phycocyanin-rich (PC-rich) strains and (ii) strains containing both PC and phycoerythrin (PE). Strains of the latter phenotype were all capable of complementary chromatic adaptation (CCA). About 65 kb of the Pseudanabaena genomes were sequenced through a multilocus sequencing approach including the sequencing of the16 and 23S rRNA genes, the ribosomal intergenic spacer (IGS), internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS-1), the cpcBA operon encoding PC and the IGS between cpcA and cpcB. In addition, the presence of nifH, one of the structural genes of nitrogenase, was investigated. Sequence analysis of ITS and cpcBA-IGS allowed the differentiation between Pseudanabaena isolates exhibiting high levels of microdiversity. This multilocus sequencing approach revealed specific clusters for the BS, the AV and a mixed cluster with strains from both ecosystems. The latter comprised exclusively CCA phenotypes. The phylogenies of the 16 and 23S rRNA genes are consistent, but analysis of other loci indicated the loss of substructure, suggesting that the recombination between these loci has occurred. Our preliminary results on population genetic analyses of the PC genes suggest an evolutionary diversification of Pseudanabaena through purifying selection.},

            Prokaryotic extracellular enzymatic activity, abundance, heterotrophic production and respiration were determined in the meso‐ and bathypelagic (sub)tropical North Atlantic. While prokaryotic heterotrophic production (PHP) decreased from the lower euphotic layer to the bathypelagic waters by two orders of magnitude, prokaryotic abundance and cell‐specific PHP decreased only by one order of magnitude. In contrast to cell‐specific PHP, cell‐specific extracellular enzymatic activity (alpha‐ and beta‐glucosidase, leucine aminopeptidase, alkaline phosphatase) increased with depth as did cell‐specific respiration rates. Cell‐specific alkaline phosphatase activity increased from the intermediate water masses to the deep waters up to fivefold. Phosphate concentrations, however, varied only by a factor of two between the different water masses, indicating that phosphatase activity is not related to phosphate availability in the deep waters. Generally, cell‐specific extracellular enzymatic activities were inversely related to cell‐specific prokaryotic leucine incorporation. Thus, it is apparent that the utilization of deep ocean organic matter is linked to higher cell‐specific extracellular enzymatic activity and respiration and lower cell‐specific PHP than in surface waters.},

              We demonstrate here results showing that bottom‐up and top‐down control mechanisms can operate simultaneously and in concert in marine microbial food webs, controlling prokaryote diversity by a combination of viral lysis and substrate limitation. Models in microbial ecology predict that a shift in the type of bacterial growth rate limitation is expected to have a major effect on species composition within the community of bacterial hosts, with a subsequent shift in the composition of the viral community. Only moderate effects would, however, be expected in the absolute number of coexisting virus–host pairs. We investigated these relationships in nutrient‐manipulated systems, under simulated
              in situ
              conditions. There was a strong correlation in the clustering of the viral and bacterial community data supporting the existence of an important link between the bacterial and viral communities. As predicted, the total number of viral populations was the same in all treatments, while the composition of the viral community varied. Our results support the theoretical prediction that there is one control mechanism for the number of niches for coexisting virus–host pairs (top‐down control), and another mechanism that controls which virus–host pairs occupy these niches (bottom‐up control).},

	abstract = {Summary
            1. We used flow cytometry to characterize freshwater photosynthetic picoplankton (PPP) and heterotrophic bacteria (HB) in Lake Kivu, one of the East‐African great lakes. Throughout three cruises run in different seasons, covering the four major basins, phycoerythrin‐rich cells dominated the PPP. Heterotrophic bacteria and PPP cell numbers were always high and spatial variations were modest. This represents an important difference from temperate and high latitude lakes that show high fluctuations in cell abundance over an annual cycle.
            
              2. Three populations of picocyanobacteria were identified: one corresponded to single‐cells (identified as
              Synechococcus
              by epifluorescence microscopy, molecular methods and pigment content), and the two other that most probably correspond to two and four celled colonies of the same taxon. The proportion of these two subpopulations was greater under stratified conditions, with stronger nutrient limitation.
            
            
              3. High PPP concentrations (
              c.
              10
              5
               cell mL
              −1

              c.

               cell mL
              −1
              ) were always found. Lake Kivu supports relatively less bacteria than phytoplankton biomass than temperate systems, probably as a consequence of factors such as temperature, oligotrophy, nutrient limitation and trophic structure.
            
            
              4. A review of PPP concentration across aquatic systems suggests that the abundance of
              Synechococcus
              ‐like cyanobacteria in large, oligotrophic, tropical lakes is very high.
            
            5. Photosynthetic picoplankton cell abundances in the oligotrophic tropical lakes Kivu and Tanganyika are comparable to those of eutrophic temperate lakes. This apparently contradicts the view that PPP abundance increases with increasing eutrophy. More data on PPP in tropical lakes are needed to explore further this particular pattern.},

              Since heterotrophic prokaryotes play an important biogeochemical role in aquatic ecosystems and have a high capacity to survive in extreme environments, easy-to-perform protocols that probe their physiological states and the effects of environmental variables on those states are highly desired. Some methodologies combine a general nucleic acid stain with a membrane integrity probe. We calibrated one of these, the nucleic acid double-staining (NADS) protocol (G. Grégori, S. Citterio, A. Ghiani, M. Labra, S. Sgorbati, S. Brown, and M. Denis, Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 67:4662-4670, 2001), determining the optimal stain concentrations in seawater and the response to conditions that generate prokaryote death (such as heat) and to conditions that are known to produce death in plankton, such as nutrient limitation or flagellate grazing. The protocol was validated by comparison to two methods used to detect viability: active respiration by 5-cyano-2,3-ditolyl tetrazolium chloride (CTC) and incorporation of tritiated leucine. We show that concentrations in the range of 5 to 20 μg ml
              −1
              of propidium iodide, simultaneous to a 10× concentration of Sybr green I, are best for detecting two separated populations of “live” (green cells) and “dead” (red cells) organisms. During exposure to heat and UVC, we observed that the number of live cells declined concurrently with that of actively respiring cells (CTC positive) and with total leucine incorporation. In seawater mesocosms, the NADS protocol allowed detection of bacterioplankton starvation-related death and flagellate predation. The protocol was also tested in deep profiles in the northwest Atlantic, demonstrating its potential for routine characterization of this fraction of the physiological diversity of marine heterotrophic prokaryotic plankton.},

              Marine cyanobacteria of the genera
              Prochlorococcus
              and
              Synechococcus
              are important contributors to global primary production occupying a key position at the base of marine food webs. The genetically diverse nature of each genus is likely an important reason for their successful colonization of vast tracts of the world's oceans, a feature that has led to detailed analysis of the distribution of these genetic lineages at the local and ocean basin scale. Here, we extend these analyses to the global dimension, using new data from cruises in the Pacific, Indian and Arctic Oceans in combination with data from previous studies in the Atlantic Ocean, Arabian Sea, Red Sea and a circumnavigation of the southern hemisphere to form a data set which comprises most of the world's major ocean systems. We show that the distribution patterns of
              Prochlorococcus
              and
              Synechococcus
              lineages are remarkably similar in different ocean systems with comparable environmental conditions, but producing a strikingly different ‘signature’ in the four major ocean domains or biomes (the Polar Domain, Coastal Boundary Domain, Trade Winds Domain and Westerly Winds Domain). This clearly reiterates the idea of spatial partitioning of individual cyanobacterial lineages, but at the global scale.},

              We used mesocosm experiments to study the bacterioplankton community in a highly dynamic coastal ecosystem during four contrasting periods of the seasonal cycle: winter mixing, spring phytoplankton bloom, summer stratification and autumn upwelling. A correlation approach was used in order to measure the degree of coupling between the dynamics of major bacterial groups, heterotrophic carbon cycling and environmental factors. We used catalysed reporter deposition‐fluorescence
              in situ
              hybridization to follow changes in the relative abundance of the most abundant groups of bacteria (Alphaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria and Bacteroidetes). Bacterial carbon flux‐related variables included bacterial standing stock, bacterial production and microbial respiration. The environmental factors included both, biotic variables such as chlorophyll‐a concentration, primary production, phytoplankton extracellular release, and abiotic variables such as the concentration of dissolved inorganic and organic nutrients. Rapid shifts in the dominant bacterial groups occurred associated to environmental changes and bacterial bulk functions. An alternation between Alphaproteobacteria and Bacteroidetes was observed associated to different phytoplankton growth phases. The dominance of the group Bacteroidetes was related to high bacterial biomass and production. We found a significant, non‐spurious, linkage between the relative abundances of major bacterial groups and bacterial carbon cycling. Our results suggest that bacteria belonging to these major groups could actually share a function in planktonic ecosystems.},

              Metabolic diversity of heterotrophic bacterioplankton was tracked from early winter through spring with Biolog Ecoplates under the seasonally ice covered arctic shelf in the Canadian Arctic (Franklin Bay, Beaufort Sea). Samples were taken every 6 days from December 2003 to May 2004 at the surface, the halocline where a temperature inversion occurs, and at 200 m, close to the bottom. Despite the low nutrient levels and low chlorophyll

              concentrations increased. Denaturing gradient gel electrophorisis analysis also indicated that the winter and spring bacterial communities were phylogenetically distinct, with several new bands appearing in spring. In spring, the bacterial community would have access to the freshly produced organic carbon from the early phytoplankton bloom and the growth of rapidly growing specialist phenotypes would be favoured. In contrast, in winter bacterioplankton consumed more complex organic matter originated during the previous year's phytoplankton production. At the other depths we tested the NSU was similar to that for the winter surface, with no seasonal pattern. Instead, bacterioplankton metabolism seemed to be influenced by resuspension, advection, and sedimentation events that contributed organic matter that enhanced bacterial metabolism.},

            The aim of this study was to explore the use of large‐scale sequencing to better describe the genome content of naturally occurring, uncultured protists. We constructed a metagenomic fosmid library from a picoplanktonic assemblage (0.2–3 μm size cells) collected at the Blanes Bay Microbial Observatory (Western Mediterranean). Seven clones contained a small‐subunit ribosomal RNA gene (SSU rDNA) affiliating with prasinophytes and uncultured alveolates. One clone (FBB25; 35 kb in size) was completely sequenced and found to be a tandem repeat array (5.5 times) of the rDNA operon, including three rRNA genes (SSU, large‐subunit and 5.8S rDNAs) and three spacer regions (internal transcribed spacers 1, 2 and intergenic spacer). The SSU rDNA of FBB25 affiliated with the marine alveolates group I, cluster 1, and was almost identical to sequences retrieved only in marine surveys from a wide geographic and ecological range. Phylogenetic trees using the different rRNA genes showed FBB25 as an independent branch among the main alveolate groups, but their closest affiliation varied between the SSU tree (dinoflagellates) and the large‐subunit and 5.8S trees (perkinsids). The spacer regions of FBB25 were particularly short when compared with other eukaryotes, indicating a possible genome streamlining in this picoeukaryote. Finally, not a single polymorphism was found in the rDNA repeat array, suggesting that the high SSU rDNA variability typically found in molecular surveys derives from organismal and not intragenomic diversity. This first report on the rDNA genomic structure of an uncultured marine alveolate improves their phylogenetic position and helps interpreting data generated during picoeukaryotic molecular surveys.},

              Syndiniales
              are a parasitic order within the eukaryotic lineage
              Dinophyceae
              (
              Alveolata
              ). Here, we analysed the taxonomy of this group using 43655 18S rRNA gene sequences obtained either from environmental data sets or cultures, including 6874 environmental sequences from this study derived from Atlantic and Mediterranean waters. A total of 5571 out of the 43655 sequences analysed fell within the
              Dinophyceae
              . Both bayesian and maximum likelihood phylogenies placed
              Syndiniales
              in five main groups (I–V), as a monophyletic lineage at the base of ‘core’ dinoflagellates (all
              Dinophyceae
              except
              Syndiniales
              ), although the latter placement was not bootstrap supported. Thus, the two uncultured novel marine alveolate groups I and II, which have been highlighted previously, are confirmed to belong to the
              Syndiniales
              . These groups were the most diverse and highly represented in environmental studies. Within each, 8 and 44 clades were identified respectively. Co‐evolutionary trends between parasitic
              Syndiniales
              and their putative hosts were not clear, suggesting they may be relatively ‘general’ parasitoids. Based on the overall distribution patterns of the
              Syndiniales
              ‐affiliated sequences, we propose that
              Syndiniales
              are exclusively marine. Interestingly, sequences belonging to groups II, III and V were largely retrieved from the photic zone, while Group I dominated samples from anoxic and suboxic ecosystems.

            Flow cytometry has revealed the existence of two distinct fractions of bacterioplankton cells, characterized by high and low nucleic acid contents (HNA and LNA cells). Although these fractions seem ubiquitous in aquatic systems, little is known concerning the variation in the cytometric parameters used to characterize them. We have performed cytometric analyses of samples from a wide range of aquatic systems to determine the magnitude and variability in the cytometric characteristics of HNA/LNA. We show that neither group is associated to a fixed level of fluorescence and of light scatter. Rather, the relative position of HNA and LNA in the fluorescence versus side scatter cytograms varies greatly, both within and among ecosystems. Although the cytometric parameters of both groups tend to covary, there is often uncoupling between the two, particularly in light scatter. Our results show that, although the basic HNA/LNA configuration is present in most samples, its cytometric expression changes greatly in different ecosystems and along productivity gradients. The patterns in cytometric parameters do not support the simple, dichotomous view of HNA and LNA as active and inactive cells, or the notion of two distinct and independent communities, but rather suggest that there may be cells that are intrinsic to each fraction, as well as others that may exchange between fractions.},

              Viruses are known as important mortality agents of marine microorganisms. Most studies focus on bacterial and algal viruses, and few reports exist on viruses infecting marine heterotrophic protists. Here we show results from several incubations initiated with a microbial assemblage from the central Indian Ocean and amended with different amounts of organic matter. Heterotrophic flagellates developed up to 30 000 cells ml
              −1
              in the most enriched incubation. A 18S rDNA clone library and fluorescent
              in situ
              hybridization counts with newly designed probes indicated that the peak was formed by
              Cafeteria roenbergensis
              and
              Caecitellus paraparvulus
              (90\% and 10\% of the cells respectively). Both taxa were below detection in the original sample, indicating a strong positive selective bias during the enrichment. During the peak,
              C. roenbergensis
              cells were observed with virus‐like particles in the cytoplasm, and 4 days later this taxa could not be detected. Transmission electron microscopy confirmed the viral nature of these particles, which were large (280 nm), had double‐stranded DNA, and were produced with a burst size of ∼70. This virus was specific of
              C. roenbergensis
              as neither
              C. paraparvulus
              that was never seen infected, nor other flagellate taxa that developed in later stages of the incubation, appeared attacked. This is one of the few reports on a heterotrophic flagellate virus and the implications of this finding in the Indian Ocean are discussed.},

              bacteria in mesocosms that had received polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) additions. The effects of PAHs were assessed under four contrasting hydrographic conditions in the coastal upwelling system of the Rías Baixas: winter mixing, spring bloom, summer stratification and autumn upwelling. We used realistic additions of water soluble PAHs (approximately 20–30 μg l
              −1
              equivalent of chrysene), but during the winter period we also investigated the effect of higher PAHs concentrations (10–80 μg l

              group play a major role in low molecular weight PAHs biodegradation in this planktonic ecosystem. Their response was stronger in colder waters, when their background abundance was also higher. During the warm periods, the response of
              Cycloclasticus
              was limited, possibly due to both, a lower bioavailability of PAHs caused by abiotic factors (solar radiation, temperature), and by inorganic nutrient limitation of bacterial growth.},

            We show the potential of flow cytometry as a fast tool for population identification and enumeration of photosynthetic sulfur bacteria. Purple (PSB) and green sulfur bacteria (GSB) oxidize hydrogen sulfide to elemental sulfur that can act as storage compound to be further oxidized to sulfate generating the reducing power required for growth. Both groups have different elemental sulfur allocation strategies: whereas PSB store elemental sulfur as intracellular inclusions, GSB allocate sulfur globules externally. We used well‐characterized laboratory strains and complex natural photosynthetic populations developing in a sharply stratified meromictic lake to show that PSB and GSB could be detected, differentiated and enumerated in unstained samples using a blue laser‐based flow cytometer. Variations in cell‐specific pigment content and the dynamics of sulfur accumulation, both intra‐ and extracellularly, were also detected in flow cytometric plots as sulfur accumulation changed the light scatter characteristics of the cells. These data were used to show the potential for studies on the metabolic status and the rate of activity at the single‐cell level. Flow cytometric identification and enumeration resulted in faster and more precise analyses than previous approaches, and may open the door to more complex ecophysiological experiments with photosynthetic sulfur bacteria in mixed cultures and natural environments.},

              Microbial successions were studied in experimental mesocosms of marine water in the presence of additional organic carbon (glucose), phosphorus (P) or both. P addition lead to pronounced blooms of phytoplankton and to significantly enhanced bacterial production. Characteristic succession patterns were observed for two phylogenetic groups of bacteria that both transiently formed {\textgreater} 50\% of total cells. An initial bloom of bacteria affiliated to the
              Alteromonadaceae
              could not be assigned to any specific treatment and was interpreted as a response to the manipulations during mesocosm set‐up. These bacteria rapidly declined with the appearance of heterotrophic nanoflagellates, suggesting a negative effect of selective grazing. The persistence of
              Alteromonadaceae
              in the microbial assemblages was significantly favored by the presence of additional glucose. During the second half of the experiment, bacteria affiliated to
              Rhodobacteriaceae
              formed a dominant component of the experimental assemblages in treatments with addition of P. The community contribution of
              Rhodobacteriaceae
              was significantly correlated with chlorophyll

              Rhodobacteriaceae
              was high, and treatment‐specific temporal successions of genotypes related to
              Rhodobacteriaceae
              were observed. We suggest that the observed succession patterns reflect different niche preferences:
              Alteromonadaceae
              rapidly responded to disturbance and profited from allochthonous glucose input, whereas
              Rhodobacteriaceae
              benefited from the phytoplankton bloom.},

              We analyzed the contributions of different heterotrophic bacterial groups to the uptake of several low-molecular weight compounds during a seasonal cycle on the northwestern Mediterranean coast (Blanes Bay Microbial Observatory). The bacterial assemblage structure had been shown to change substantially year-round for this site, but whether changes in the activities of the different bacterial groups also occurred on the seasonal scale was unknown. Microautoradiography combined with catalyzed reporter deposition fluorescence in situ hybridization was used to analyze the patterns of glucose, amino acid, and ATP uptake by different bacterial groups.
              Gammaproteobacteria
              and
              Bacteroidetes
              were not very active in the uptake of glucose at any time of the year ({\textless}10\% of cells were active) compared to
              Alphaproteobacteria
              (generally {\textgreater}20\% of cells were active). Dissolved free amino acids were taken up considerably by
              Alphaproteobacteria
              and
              Gammaproteobacteria
              but not by
              Bacteroidetes
              . Relatively high percentages of cells of the three broad phylogenetic groups actively took up ATP, which could be related to the important phosphorous limitation of bacterial production during most of the year in Blanes Bay. The contribution of SAR11 to the uptake of the monomers was variable year-round, generally with fewer than 30\% of the cells being active. By contrast,
              Roseobacter
              were highly overrepresented in the uptake of all the substrates throughout all the year, with more than 50\% of cells being active in all the samples and for all substrates. Our results suggest that substantial changes in the activity of some phylogenetic groups of bacteria occur throughout the year.},

Ingestion rates of fluorescently labeled bacteria were estimated for different size categories of phytoflagellates (PF) and heterotrophic flagellates (HF) in short‐term experiments and compared with long‐term grazing estimates and published empirical models. The mixotrophic flagellates included haptophyte‐like cells, cryptophytes, and dinoflagellates. The group‐specific grazing rates (SGR) averaged 1.1 (3–5 µm PF), 1.3 (5–20 µm PF), 4.0 ({\textless}5 µm HF), and 15.4 bacteria individual

              (5‐20 µm HF). Lower SGR but higher abundances of PF resulted in an average mixotroph contribution of 50\% to the total flagellate grazing. Remarkably, the effect was relatively high all through the year (35–65\%). Regardless of the presence of chloroplasts, flagellates {\textless}5 mm in size accounted, on average, for about 80\% of total flagellate bacterivory and ingested a large percentage of their cell carbon per day from bacteria. Soluble reactive phosphorus concentration was negatively correlated with the ingestion rate of both groups of PF, suggesting that mixotrophic flagellates would be using their phagotrophic capability to obtain phosphorus when this nutrient is limiting. HF grazing activity showed a marked seasonality, with grazing being higher during the warmer seasons, and clearance rates were positively correlated with water temperature. Total bacterivory accounted for most of the bacterial production. Short‐term and long‐term bacterivory measurements were highly correlated, confirming that the smallest flagellates were the main causative agent of bacterial loss. The bacterivory values were also well correlated to a published empirical model that considers HF as the only bacterivorous. However, this model underestimated (up to 50\%) total flagellate grazing during periods of high effect of mixotrophic flagellates.},

The variation of GPP among sites was less than one order of magnitude. Mesozooplankton dominated by doliolids (Tunicata), but not those dominated by copepods, presumably exerted efficient control of the autotrophic biomass, thereby buffering responses of autotrophs to high nutrient input. Among the many factors that can modify the responses of autotrophs to nutrients, the time scale over which the enrichment is made and the precise mode of nutrient enrichment are important. We suggest a general concept that may contribute to a scientific basis for understanding and managing coastal eutrophication.},

In contrast, bacterial abundance and production showed little response. Primary production showed a much greater increase in response to aerosol inputs than community respiration did, so that the P/R ratio increased from around 0.95 in the ambient waters, where communities were close to metabolic balance, to 3.3 at the highest nutrient inputs, indicative of a high excess production and a potential for substantial net CO

              Heterotrophic flagellates play fundamental roles in marine ecosystems as picoplankton grazers. This recognized importance contrasts with our ignorance of the taxonomic composition of this functional group, which remains mostly unidentified by microscopical and culturing approaches. Recent molecular marine surveys based on 18S rDNA genes have retrieved many sequences unrelated to cultured organisms and marine stramenopiles were among the first reported uncultured eukaryotes. However, little is known about the organisms corresponding to these sequences. Here we determine the abundance of several marine stramenopile lineages in surface marine waters using molecular probes and fluorescent
              in situ
              hybridization. We show that these protists are free‐living bacterivorous heterotrophic flagellates. They were widely distributed, occurring in the five world oceans, and accounted for a significant fraction (up to 35\%) of heterotrophic flagellates in diverse geographic regions. A single group, MAST‐4, represented 9\% of cells within this functional assemblage, with the intriguing exception of polar waters where it was absent. MAST‐4 cells likely contribute substantially to picoplankton grazing and nutrient re‐mineralization in vast areas of the oceans and represent a key eukaryotic group in marine food webs.},

              We analyzed microbial eukaryote diversity in perennially cold arctic marine waters by using 18S rRNA gene clone libraries. Samples were collected during concurrent oceanographic missions to opposite sides of the Arctic Ocean Basin and encompassed five distinct water masses. Two deep water Arctic Ocean sites and the convergence of the Greenland, Norwegian, and Barents Seas were sampled from 28 August to 2 September 2002. An additional sample was obtained from the Beaufort Sea (Canada) in early October 2002. The ribotypes were diverse, with different communities among sites and between the upper mixed layer and just below the halocline. Eukaryotes from the remote Canada Basin contained new phylotypes belonging to the radiolarian orders Acantharea, Polycystinea, and Taxopodida. A novel group within the photosynthetic stramenopiles was also identified. One sample closest to the interior of the Canada Basin yielded only four major taxa, and all but two of the sequences recovered belonged to the polar diatom
              Fragilariopsis
              and a radiolarian. Overall, 42\% of the sequences were {\textless}98\% similar to any sequences in GenBank. Moreover, 15\% of these were {\textless}95\% similar to previously recovered sequences, which is indicative of endemic or undersampled taxa in the North Polar environment. The cold, stable Arctic Ocean is a threatened environment, and climate change could result in significant loss of global microbial biodiversity.},

              We studied the effects of natural sunlight on heterotrophic marine bacterioplankton in short-term experiments. We used a single-cell level approach involving flow cytometry combined with physiological probes and microautoradiography to determine sunlight effects on the activity and integrity of the cells. After 4 h of sunlight exposure, most bacterial cells maintained membrane integrity and viability as assessed by the simultaneous staining with propidium iodide and SYBR green I. In contrast, a significant inhibition of heterotrophic bacterial activity was detected, measured by 5-cyano-2,3 ditolyl tetrazolium chloride reduction and leucine incorporation. We applied microautoradiography combined with catalyzed reporter deposition-fluorescence in situ hybridization to test the sensitivity of the different bacterial groups naturally occurring in the Northwestern Mediterranean to sunlight. Members of the
              Gammaproteobacteria
              and
              Bacteroidetes
              groups appeared to be highly resistant to solar radiation, with small changes in activity after exposure. On the contrary,
              Alphaproteobacteria
              bacteria were more sensitive to radiation as measured by the cell-specific incorporation of labeled amino acids, leucine, and ATP. Within
              Alphaproteobacteria
              , bacteria belonging to the
              Roseobacter
              group showed higher resistance than members of the SAR11 cluster. The activity of
              Roseobacter
              was stimulated by exposure to photosynthetic available radiation compared to the dark treatment. Our results suggest that UV radiation can significantly affect the in situ single-cell activity of bacterioplankton and that naturally dominating phylogenetic bacterial groups have different sensitivity to natural levels of incident solar radiation.},

Using the same approach on coastal samples, we have identified a novel group of protist small subunit (SSU) rDNA sequences that do not correspond to any phylogenetic group previously identified. Comparison with other sequences obtained from cultures of heterotrophic protists showed that the environmental sequences grouped together with
              Telonema
              , a genus known since 1913 but of uncertain taxonomic affinity. Phylogenetic analyses using four genes (SSU,

              alpha-tubulin

              Telonema

              Telonema

              Telonema
              constitutes a new eukaryotic phylum, here defined as Telonemia, possibly representing a key clade for the understanding of the early evolution of bikont protist groups, such as the proposed chromalveolate supergroup.},

              We studied the effects of nutrient availability and protistan grazing on bacterial dynamics and community composition (BCC) in different parts of the canyon-shaped Římov reservoir (Czech Republic). The effects of protistan grazing on BCC were examined using a size fractionation approach. Water from the dam area with only bacteria ({\textless}0.8 μm), bacteria and heterotrophic nanoflagellates ({\textless}5 μm), or whole water were incubated in situ inside dialysis bags. Top-down or predator manipulations (size fractionation) were also combined with bottom-up or resource manipulations, i.e., transplantation of samples to the middle and upper inflow parts of the reservoir with increased phosphorus availability. Significant genotypic shifts in BCC occurred with transplantation as indicated by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis. Using different probes for fluorescence in situ hybridization, we found that 10 to 50\% of total bacteria were members of the phylogenetically small cluster of β-proteobacteria (targeted with the probe R-BT065). These rod-shaped cells of very uniform size were vulnerable to predation but very fast growing and responded markedly to the different experimental manipulations. In all the grazer-free treatments, the members of the R-BT065 cluster showed the highest net growth rates of all studied bacterial groups. Moreover, their relative abundance was highly correlated with bacterial bulk parameters and proportions of bacteria with high nucleic acid (HNA) content. In contrast, increasing protistan bacterivory yielded lower proportions of R-BT065-positive and HNA bacteria substituted by increasing proportions of the class
              Actinobacteria
              , which profited from the enhanced protistan bacterivory.},

              The results of empirical studies have revealed links between phytoplankton and bacterioplankton, such as the frequent correlation between chlorophyll
              a
              and bulk bacterial abundance and production. Nevertheless, little is known about possible links at the level of specific taxonomic groups. To investigate this issue, seawater microcosm experiments were performed in the northwestern Mediterranean Sea. Turbulence was used as a noninvasive means to induce phytoplankton blooms dominated by different algae. Microcosms exposed to turbulence became dominated by diatoms, while small phytoflagellates gained importance under still conditions. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of 16S rRNA gene fragments showed that changes in phytoplankton community composition were followed by shifts in bacterioplankton community composition, both as changes in the presence or absence of distinct bacterial phylotypes and as differences in the relative abundance of ubiquitous phylotypes. Sequencing of DGGE bands showed that four
              Roseobacter
              phylotypes were present in all microcosms. The microcosms with a higher proportion of phytoflagellates were characterized by four phylotypes of the
              Bacteroidetes
              phylum: two affiliated with the family
              Cryomorphaceae
              and two with the family
              Flavobacteriaceae
              . Two other
              Flavobacteriaceae
              phylotypes were characteristic of the diatom-dominated microcosms, together with one
              Alphaproteobacteria
              phylotype (
              Roseobacter
              ) and one
              Gammaproteobacteria
              phylotype (
              Methylophaga
              ). Phylogenetic analyses of published
              Bacteroidetes
              16S rRNA gene sequences confirmed that members of the
              Flavobacteriaceae
              are remarkably responsive to phytoplankton blooms, indicating these bacteria could be particularly important in the processing of organic matter during such events. Our data suggest that quantitative and qualitative differences in phytoplankton species composition may lead to pronounced differences in bacterioplankton species composition.},

First, primers specific for eukaryotic 18S rDNA were used in a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with environmental DNA. The amplification products were subjected to denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). Transect DOVETAIL (44°W) went from the ice edge (at 60°S) across the Weddell‐Scotia confluence and north to 58°S; it was sampled in January 1998 (summer). Transect DHARMA (between 53°W and 58°W) went from the ice edge in the Weddell Sea (63°S) across the Drake Passage to the South American continental platform (55°S); it was sampled in December 1998 (late spring). DGGE band patterns were used to build dendrograms combining samples from each cruise. Samples were grouped in several distinct clusters that were generally consistent with the hydrography of the area. In DOVETAIL, the upper water column was stratified and the DGGE band patterns varied with depth. In DHARMA the upper mixed layer showed the same composition of the eukaryotic picoplankton at all depths. The most dominant DGGE bands were excised and sequenced. Some were closely related to well‐known components of the plankton such as prasinophytes, prymnesiophytes, dinoflagellates, and diatoms. A significant number of sequences were related to previously unknown phylogenetic groups, including novel stramenopiles and alveolates or to poorly known groups such as cercomonads. This fingerprinting technique is useful for a rapid evaluation of the spatial distribution of picoeukaryotic assemblages in the oceans.},

            Culture-independent molecular analyses of open-sea microorganisms have revealed the existence and apparent abundance of novel eukaryotic lineages, opening new avenues for phylogenetic, evolutionary, and ecological research. Novel marine stramenopiles, identified by 18S ribosomal DNA sequences within the basal part of the stramenopile radiation but unrelated to any previously known group, constituted one of the most important novel lineages in these open-sea samples. Here we carry out a comparative analysis of novel stramenopiles, including new sequences from coastal genetic libraries presented here and sequences from recent reports from the open ocean and marine anoxic sites. Novel stramenopiles were found in all major habitats, generally accounting for a significant proportion of clones in genetic libraries. Phylogenetic analyses indicated the existence of 12 independent clusters. Some of these were restricted to anoxic or deep-sea environments, but the majority were typical components of coastal and open-sea waters. We specifically identified four clusters that were well represented in most marine surface waters (together they accounted for 74\% of the novel stramenopile clones) and are the obvious targets for future research. Many sequences were retrieved from geographically distant regions, indicating that some organisms were cosmopolitan. Our study expands our knowledge on the phylogenetic diversity and distribution of novel marine stramenopiles and confirms that they are fundamental members of the marine eukaryotic picoplankton.},

              Photosynthetic microorganisms play a crucial role in the marine environment. In vast areas of the oceans, marine primary productivity is performed by cells smaller than 2–3 µm (picoplankton). Here, we report on molecular analyses of the conserved photosynthetic

	abstract = {Summary
            Proteorhodopsins, ubiquitous retinylidene photoactive proton pumps, were recently found in the widespread uncultured SAR86 bacterial group in oceanic surface waters. To survey proteorhodopsin diversity, new degenerate sets of proteorhodopsin primers were designed based on a genomic proteorhodopsin gene sequence originating from an Antarctic fosmid library. New proteorhodopsin variants were identified in Red Sea samples that were most similar to the original green‐light absorbing proteorhodopsins found in Monterey Bay California. Unlike green‐absorbing proteorhodopsins however, these new variants contained a glutamine residue at position 105, the same site recently shown to control spectral tuning in naturally occurring proteorhodopsins. Different proteorhodopsin variants were also found in the Mediterranean Sea. These proteorhodopsins formed new and distinctive proteorhodopsin groups. Phylogenetic analyses show that some of the new variants were very different from previously characterized proteorhodopsins, and formed the deepest branching groups found so far among marine proteorhodopsins. The existence of these varied proteorhodopsin sequences suggests that this class of proteins has undergone substantial evolution. These variants could represent functionally divergent paralogous genes, derived from the same or similar species, or orthologous proteorhodopsins that are distributed amongst divergent planktonic microbial taxa.},

	abstract = {We performed a transplant experiment in eutrophic Sau reservoir to assess the factors that control bacterial abundance, activity, growth rate, and community composition. Samples from the lacustrine and the riverine ends of the reservoir were incubated in dialysis bags placed in situ and transplanted to the other side of the reservoir and also incubated after 1 µm filtration to measure predator effects. The bags were sampled at 12‐h intervals to estimate bacterial abundance, whole community activity, activity structure (by flow cytometry), and phylogenetic composition (by in situ hybridization with group‐specific phylogenetic probes). Bacterial production was always regulated by nutrient supply, but abundance and activity were differently regulated at both sites. The riverine bacteria were limited by predator activity, whereas the lacustrine were regulated by a combination of predation  and nutrient supply. Therefore, even in the same environment, different modes of control can act simultaneously. Bacterial activity structure was also regulated in the same way. Abundance of high DNA bacteria and cells hybridizing with the universal EUB338 probe were well correlated. In the lacustrine sample, bacterial community structure did not change significantly, whereas in the riverine sample, Α‐ and Δ‐Proteobacteria reduced their growth when transplanted, whereas Β‐Proteobacteria were stimulated by the presence of predators. Members of the Cytophaga/Flavobacterium phylum grew only when incubated in situ in the absence of predators. This different behavior in the different bacterial groups resulted in strong changes in bacterial assemblage composition, evident already after 24 h. The experiment demonstrates that, together with the effect of predators, nutrient supply affects bacterial community properties and that a complex regulation involving both types of control can occur in a single heterogeneous planktonic system.},

            Microbial communities inhabiting a multipond solar saltern were analysed and compared using SSU rRNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR)‐based fingerprintings carried out in parallel by four laboratories. A salinity gradient from seawater (3.7\%) to NaCl precipitation (37\%) was studied for Bacteria, Archaea and Eukarya, and laboratories applied their own techniques and protocols on the same set of samples. Members of all three domains were retrieved from all salt concentrations. Three fingerprinting techniques were used: denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), ribosomal internal spacer analysis (RISA), and terminal‐restriction fragments length polymorphism (T‐RFLP). In addition, each laboratory used its own biomass collection method and DNA extraction protocols. Prokaryotes were addressed using DGGE and RISA with different ‘domain‐specific’ primers sets. Eukaryotes were analysed by one laboratory using DGGE and T‐RFLP, but targeting the same 18S rDNA site. Fingerprints were compared through cluster analysis and non‐metric multidimensional scaling plots. This exercise allowed fast comparison of microbial assemblages and determined to what extent the picture provided by each laboratory was similar to those of others. Formation of two main, salinity‐based groups of samples in prokaryotes (4–15\% and 22–37\% salinity) was consistent for all the laboratories. When other clusters appeared, this was a result of the particular technique and the protocol used in each case, but more affected by the primers set used. Eukaryotic microorganisms changed more from pond to pond; 4–5\% and 8–37\% salinity were but the two main groups detected. Archaea showed the lowest number of bands whereas Eukarya showed the highest number of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) in the initial ponds. Artefacts appeared in the DGGE from ponds with extremely low microbial richness. On the other hand, different 16S rDNA fragments with the same restriction or internal transcribed spacer (ITS) length were the main limitations for T‐RFLP and RISA analyses, respectively, in ponds with the highest OTUs richness. However, although the particular taxonomic composition could vary among protocols, the general structure of the microbial assemblages was maintained.},

	abstract = {Summary
            
              Bacterial and archaeal assemblages have been studied in a multipond solar saltern using a range of microbial ecology techniques by four laboratories simultaneously. These include 16S rDNA sequencing from both denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and clone libraries, and culturing methods. Water samples from eight ponds were analysed, covering a salinity range from near sea water (4\% salt) to saturated sodium chloride (37\% salt; ponds called crystallizers). Clone libraries focused on ponds with salinity of 8\%, 22\% and 32\%. Although different cloning strategies were able to retrieve the same type of dominant sequences, there were differing degrees of success with less abundant sequences. Thus, the use of two sets of primers recovered a higher number of phylotypes. Bacterial and archaeal isolates were, however, different from any of the retrieved environmental sequences. For Bacteria, most sequences in the 8\% salt pond were related to organisms of marine origin. Thus, representatives of the alpha‐, beta‐, gamma‐ and epsilon‐subdivisions of Proteobacteria, the
              Cytophaga–Flavobacterium–Bacteroides
              group (CFB), high‐G+C Gram‐positive bacteria and cyanobacteria were found. In the
 22\% salt pond, alpha‐ and gamma‐Proteobacteria, cyanobacteria and CFB were
 the only groups found, and most of them were related to specialized halophilic bacteria.
 From the 32\% salt pond, only CFB were found, and most of the sequences retrieved
 clustered with
              Salinibacter ruber
              , an extremely halophilic bacterium. A decrease
 in the richness of bacterial genera was therefore apparent along the gradient. Archaea
 behaved quite similarly. In the lowest salinity ponds, sequences were related to
 environmental clones of Marine Archaea Group III (
              Thermoplasmales
              relatives)
 and to unclassified branches of Euryarchaeaota. In the 8\%, 22\% and
 32\% ponds, most of the clones were related to different cultured strains
 of Halobacteriaceae. Finally, most sequences from the crystallizers clustered with
 the uncultured square archaeon SPhT. Crenarchaeaota were not detected. Despite the
 fact that higher prokaryotic richness was apparent in the lower salinity ponds than
 in the crystallizers, the diversity index from clone libraries calculated according
 to Shannon and Weaver did not show this trend. This was because diversity in the
 crystallizers can be considered as ‘microdiversity’, the co‐existence
 of several closely related clones of Bacteria (the
              S. ruber
              cluster) and Archaea (the SPhT cluster). Regardless of the changes in abundance, both Bacteria and Archaea showed the same pattern; as salinity increased, the number of different clusters decreased, and only one cluster became dominant. Both clusters, however, showed a considerable degree of microdiversity. The meaning of such microdiversity remains to be determined.},

            Despite the fact that the smallest eukaryotes (cells less than 5 μm in diameter) play key roles in marine food webs, particularly in open oligotrophic areas, the study of their in situ diversity started just one year ago. Perhaps the most remarkable finding of the most recent studies has been the discovery of completely new phylogenetic lineages, such as novel clades belonging to the stramenopile and alveolate phyla. The two new groups account for a significant fraction of clones in genetic libraries from North Atlantic, equatorial Pacific, Antarctic, and Mediterranean Sea waters. However, the identities and ecological relevance of these organisms remain unknown. Here we investigate the phylogenetic relationships, morphology, in situ abundance, and ecological role of novel stramenopiles. They form at least eight independent clades within the stramenopile basal branches, indicating a large phylogenetic diversity within the group. Two lineages were visualized and enumerated in field samples and enrichments by fluorescent in situ hybridization using specific rRNA-targeted oligonucleotide probes. The targeted organisms were 2- to 3-μm-diameter, round-shaped, nonpigmented flagellates. Further, they were found to be bacterivorous. One lineage accounted for up to 46\% (average during an annual cycle, 19\%) of heterotrophic flagellates in a coastal environment, providing evidence that novel stramenopiles are important and unrecognized components of the total stock of bacterial grazers.},

            We used denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) to study the diversity of picoeukaryotes in natural marine assemblages. Two eukaryote-specific primer sets targeting different regions of the 18S rRNA gene were tested. Both primer sets gave a single band when used with algal cultures and complex fingerprints when used with natural assemblages. The reproducibility of the fingerprints was estimated by quantifying the intensities of the same bands obtained in independent PCR and DGGE analyses, and the standard error of these estimates was less than 2\% on average. DGGE fingerprints were then used to compare the picoeukaryotic diversity in samples obtained at different depths and on different dates from a station in the southwest Mediterranean Sea. Both primer sets revealed significant differences along the vertical profile, whereas temporal differences at the same depths were less marked. The phylogenetic composition of picoeukaryotes from one surface sample was investigated by excising and sequencing DGGE bands. The results were compared with an analysis of a clone library and a terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism fingerprint obtained from the same sample. The three PCR-based methods, performed with three different primer sets, revealed very similar assemblage compositions; the same main phylogenetic groups were present at similar relative levels. Thus, the prasinophyte group appeared to be the most abundant group in the surface Mediterranean samples as determined by our molecular analyses. DGGE bands corresponding to prasinophytes were always found in surface samples but were not present in deep samples. Other groups detected were prymnesiophytes, novel stramenopiles (distantly related to hyphochytrids or labyrinthulids), cryptophytes, dinophytes, and pelagophytes. In conclusion, the DGGE method described here provided a reasonably detailed view of marine picoeukaryotic assemblages and allowed tentative phylogenetic identification of the dominant members.},

These experiments will relate directly to in situ activities if all populations grow harmonically during the incubation. We tested whether this was the case by analyzing the composition of bacterial assemblages at the beginning and at the end of the incubation by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis. Five experiments were done in different Antarctic regions. Bacterial assemblages north and south of the Polar Front were very different. In all cases, the final assemblages were very different from the initial ones, and these changes were often accompanied by a significant decrease of diversity indices. Our experiments included treatments with different temperature and organic matter amendments. Whereas the increase in temperature tested had a minor effect on prokaryotic growth rate and specific composition, the addition of organic matter strongly stimulated growth rate and selected a particular bacterial assemblage in some experiments but not in others. A significant component of bacterial assemblages from waters south of the Polar Front appeared to be
              Polaribacter franzmannii
              , a gas vacuolated bacterium of the CytophagaߚFlavobacteriumߚBacteroides group that was originally isolated from Antarctic sea ice. This phylotype was enriched and dominated in almost all final assemblages. Our results indicate that longߚterm bottle incubations mostly measure the activity of a few opportunistic bacteria and not that of the original assemblage.

              H-leucine (referred to herein as Leu) was investigated in the northwestern Mediterranean Sea and in a coastal North Atlantic site, with Leu uptake rates ranging over 3 orders of magnitude. We performed in situ incubations under natural irradiance levels of Mediterranean samples taken from five depths around solar noon and compared them to incubations in the dark. In two of the three stations large differences were found between light and dark uptake rates for the surfacemost samples, with dark values being on average 133 and 109\% higher than in situ ones. Data obtained in coastal North Atlantic waters confirmed that dark enclosure may increase Leu uptake rates more than threefold. To explain these differences, on-board experiments of Leu uptake versus irradiance were performed with Mediterranean samples from depths of 5 and 40 m.

              Very small eukaryotic organisms (picoeukaryotes) are fundamental components of marine planktonic systems, often accounting for a significant fraction of the biomass and activity in a system. Their identity, however, has remained elusive, since the small cells lack morphological features for identification. We determined the diversity of marine picoeukaryotes by sequencing cloned 18S rRNA genes in five genetic libraries from North Atlantic, Southern Ocean, and Mediterranean Sea surface waters. Picoplankton were obtained by filter size fractionation, a step that excluded most large eukaryotes and recovered most picoeukaryotes. Genetic libraries of eukaryotic ribosomal DNA were screened by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis, and at least one clone of each operational taxonomic unit (OTU) was partially sequenced. In general, the phylogenetic diversity in each library was rather great, and each library included many different OTUs and members of very distantly related phylogenetic groups. Of 225 eukaryotic clones, 126 were affiliated with algal classes, especially the Prasinophyceae, the Prymnesiophyceae, the Bacillariophyceae, and the Dinophyceae. A minor fraction (27 clones) was affiliated with clearly heterotrophic organisms, such as ciliates, the chrysomonad
              Paraphysomonas
              , cercomonads, and fungi. There were two relatively abundant novel lineages, novel stramenopiles (53 clones) and novel alveolates (19 clones). These lineages are very different from any organism that has been isolated, suggesting that there are previously unknown picoeukaryotes. Prasinophytes and novel stramenopile clones were very abundant in all of the libraries analyzed. These findings underscore the importance of attempts to grow the small eukaryotic plankton in pure culture.},

            We compared the phylogenetic compositions of marine planktonic archaeal populations in different marine provinces. Samples from eight different environments were collected at two depths (surface and aphotic zone), and 16 genetic libraries of PCR-amplified archaeal 16S rRNA genes were constructed. The libraries were analyzed by using a three-step hierarchical approach. Membrane hybridization experiments revealed that most of the archaeal clones were affiliated with one of the two groups of marine archaea described previously, crenarchaeotal group I and euryarchaeotal group II. One of the 2,328 ribosomal DNA clones analyzed was related to a different euryarchaeal lineage, which was recently recovered from deep-water marine plankton. In temperate regions (Pacific Ocean, Atlantic Ocean, and Mediterranean Sea) both major groups were found at the two depths investigated; group II predominated at the surface, and group I predominated at depth. In Antarctic and subantarctic waters group II was practically absent. The clonal compositions of archaeal libraries were investigated by performing a restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis with two tetrameric restriction enzymes, which defined discrete operational taxonomic units (OTUs). The OTUs defined in this way were phylogenetically consistent; clones belonging to the same OTU were closely related. The clonal diversity as determined by the RFLP analysis was low, and most libraries were dominated by only one or two OTUs. Some OTUs were found in samples obtained from very distant places, indicating that some phylotypes were ubiquitous. A tree containing one example of each OTU detected was constructed, and this tree revealed that there were several clusters within archaeal group I and group II. The members of some of these clusters had different depth distributions.},

              The bacteria associated with oceanic algal blooms are acknowledged to play important roles in carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur cycling, yet little information is available on their identities or phylogenetic affiliations. Three culture-independent methods were used to characterize bacteria from a dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP)-producing algal bloom in the North Atlantic. Group-specific 16S rRNA-targeted oligonucleotides, 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) clone libraries, and terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis all indicated that the marine
              Roseobacter
              lineage was numerically important in the heterotrophic bacterial community, averaging {\textgreater}20\% of the 16S rDNA sampled. Two other groups of heterotrophic bacteria, the SAR86 and SAR11 clades, were also shown by the three 16S rRNA-based methods to be abundant in the bloom community. In surface waters, the
              Roseobacter
              , SAR86, and SAR11 lineages together accounted for over 50\% of the bacterial rDNA and showed little spatial variability in abundance despite variations in the dominant algal species. Depth profiles indicated that
              Roseobacter
              phylotype abundance decreased with depth and was positively correlated with chlorophyll
              a
              , DMSP, and total organic sulfur (dimethyl sulfide plus DMSP plus dimethyl sulfoxide) concentrations. Based on these data and previous physiological studies of cultured
              Roseobacter
              strains, we hypothesize that this lineage plays a role in cycling organic sulfur compounds produced within the bloom. Three other abundant bacterial phylotypes (representing a cyanobacterium and two members of the α
              Proteobacteria
              ) were primarily associated with chlorophyll-rich surface waters of the bloom (0 to 50 m), while two others (representing
              Cytophagales
              and δ
              Proteobacteria
              ) were primarily found in deeper waters (200 to 500 m).},

              A previous report of high levels of members of the domain
              Archaea
              in Antarctic coastal waters prompted us to investigate the ecology of Antarctic planktonic prokaryotes. rRNA hybridization techniques and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis of the bacterial V3 region were used to study variation in Antarctic picoplankton assemblages. In Anvers Island nearshore waters during late winter to early spring, the amounts of archaeal rRNA ranged from 17.1 to 3.6\% of the total picoplankton rRNA in 1996 and from 16.0 to 1.0\% of the total rRNA in 1995. Offshore in the Palmer Basin, the levels of archaeal rRNA throughout the water column were higher (average, 24\% of the total rRNA) during the same period in 1996. The archaeal rRNA levels in nearshore waters followed a highly seasonal pattern and markedly decreased during the austral summer at two stations. There was a significant negative correlation between archaeal rRNA levels and phytoplankton levels (as inferred from chlorophyll
              a
              concentrations) in nearshore surface waters during the early spring of 1995 and during an 8-month period in 1996 and 1997. In situ hybridization experiments revealed that 5 to 14\% of DAPI (4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole)-stained cells were archaeal, corresponding to 0.9 × 10

              4
              archaeal cells per ml, in late winter 1996 samples. Analysis of bacterial ribosomal DNA fragments by DGGE revealed that the assemblage composition may reflect changes in water column stability, depth, or season. The data indicate that changes in Antarctic seasons are accompanied by significant shifts in the species composition of bacterioplankton assemblages and by large decreases in the relative proportion of archaeal rRNA in the nearshore water column.},

	abstract = {A station located in the Gerlache Strait (Antarctic Peninsula) was sampled during early spring to determine the
vertical distribution of marine planktonic archaea and to further describe the dynamic environment where they live.
Chlorophyll concentration indicated that sampling occurred during the early stages of austral spring algal development. As expected, prokaryote abundance was higher at surface than at depth, and prokaryotic activity estimated
by leucine incorporation was low at the surface and extremely low at 500 m. The relative abundance of planktonic
archaeal, eucaryal, and bacterial ribosomal RNA was determined by quantitative rRNA hybridization, and the
performance of two different universal probes used to normalize group‐specific probe hybridization response was
compared. Archaeal rRNA was detected in all samples analyzed, and was more abundant at depth (up to 25\% of
total rRNA) than at the surface. In both years, the archaeal signal decreased during the sampling period, particularly
at surface. Most of the archaeal signal was attributable to group I archaea, affiliated with the kingdom Crenarchaeota.
Planktonic euryarchaeotes (group II archaea) showed a larger contribution to the archaeal assemblage in surface
waters than at depth. In total, our results verify that planktonic archaea are dynamic and abundant components in
marine picoplankton assemblages of the Antarctic Peninsula.},

	abstract = {Patterns in primary production and carbon export from the euphotic zone suggest that the relative contribution of planktonic heterotrophs to community biomass should decline along gradients of phytoplankton biomass and primary production. Here, we use an extensive literature data survey to test the hypothesis that the ratio of total heterotrophic (bacteria + protozoa + mesozooplankton) biomass to total autotrophic biomass (H : A ratio) is not constant in marine plankton communities but rather tends to decline with increasing phytoplankton biomass and primary production. Our results show that the plankton of unproductive regions are characterized by very high relative heterotrophic biomasses resulting in inverted biomass pyramids, whereas the plankton of productive areas are characterized by a smaller contribution of heterotrophs to community biomass and a normal biomass pyramid with a broad autotrophic base. Moreover, open‐ocean communities support significantly more heterotrophic biomass in the upper layers than do coastal communities for a given autotrophic biomass. These differences in the biomass structure of the community could be explained by the changes in the biomass‐specific rates of phytoplankton production that seem to occur from ultraoligotrophic to eutrophic marine regions, but other factors could also generate them. The patterns described suggest a rather systematic shift from consumer control of primary production and phytoplankton biomass in open ocean to resource control in upwelling and coastal areas.},

              m pore‐size filters. The total number of bacteria, the number of metabolically active cells, bacterial loss rates, and the abundances of heterotrophic nanoflagellates were measured immediately and at 3 and 6 d. Gross growth rates were similar in all treatments, suggesting that ambient nutrient concentrations set an upper limit to the maximum growth rates, whereas grazing determined the net growth rates and the final number of bacteria. Bacterial loss rates, measured as the disappearance of fluorescently labeled minicells, correlated well with the initial density of heterotrophic nanoflagellates in the different treatments. The number of active cells at the end of the experiments varied widely among treatments and reached 2.0 × 10

The final proportion of active cells was negatively correlated to both the loss rates and the initial nanoflagellate density, and it was estimated that grazing rates on metabolically active bacteria were four or more times higher than those on inactive bacteria. Heterotrophic nanoflagellates thus seemed to control bacterial density by skimming newly growing cells rather than by cropping the standing stock of bacteria.},

We developed seven algorithms which take into account both, one, or neither factor. Two cases of predation in the metalimnion of Lake Cisó (Banyoles, Spain) are used as examples to illustrate the limitations and advantages of the different approaches. In the first example (the rotifer
              Anuraeopsis fissa
              feeding on phototrophic purple bacteria) the vertical distribution of populations is very important (the populations were highly segregated), whereas use of the functional response makes very little difference. In the second example (the ciliate

              feeding on
              Cryptomnonas phaseolus

To test this proposed pattern, we collected published and unpublished data and analyzed trends across lakes, rivers, marine, and benthic samples. BA varied between 10

When data were averaged per study or per system we detected a trend with trophy, with highest HNFA in benthic systems followed by lakes and coastal areas of the sea, and lowest abundances in rivers and the open ocean. This relationship was improved in lakes, where cladoceran abundance was negatively related to HNFA. The effect of cladocerans was stronger in lakes where
              Daphnia
              spp. dominated. The weak pattern observed between BA and HNFA across systems suggests that several factors (resources, predators, environment, etc.) are acting differently on BA and HNFA. Changes in population abundances of bacteria and heterotrophic nanoflagellates are mainly determined by nutrient supply and grazing, and also by complex trophic interactions with numerous feedbacks. Empirical relationships between BA and HNFA across systems can only partially explain these changes in terms of predator‐prey dependence.},

	abstract = {To be useful in understanding natural communities, the analysis of size spectra should reveal seasonal and interlake variability. We calculated size spectra for the planktonic community of Lake Cisó. Data from 3 yr were used to analyze seasonal patterns of size distribution. The average spectrum showed peaks of biomass at 0.5–0.7, 4, 15, 32, 64, 85, and 200
              µ
              m of equivalent spherical diameter. These peaks corresponded to the dominant organisms in the lake: heterotrophic bacteria, purple phototrophic bacteria,
              Cryptomonas phaseolus,
              small ciliates including
              Coleps hirtus,
              large ciliates, rotifers including
              Anuraeopsis fissa
              , and copepods. The peak at 4
              µ
              m was the largest (3 or more times the biomass of the others). We used these data to test the utility of the size spectral approach to describe seasonal changes in the lake. Both linear and polynomial equations were fitted to the normalized spectra. Although the slope of the linear fit did not show any seasonal trend, the second‐order coefficient of the polynomial fit presented a clear pattern that made it a useful index of the degree of procaryotic dominance. The lake alternated between anaerobic conditions during mixing, when procaryotes dominated and polynomial fits were best, and stratification, when polynomial and linear curves fit equally well.},
