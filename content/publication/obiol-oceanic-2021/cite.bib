Marine heterotrophic flagellates (HFs) form a diverse and ecologically relevant functional group of bacterial grazers and nutrient remineralizers in oceanic waters. Despite playing a crucial role in marine biogeochemical cycles, there is still a lack of information on which specific taxa dominate HF assemblages and what are their patterns of distribution in a global context. In the present work, we addressed this issue by analyzing amplicon sequencing data sets retrieved from samples taken in tropical and subtropical oceanic regions at depths from surface to 4000 m. Only a few dozens of widespread taxa, mostly affiliating to MAST clades, Picozoa, Bicosoecida and Chrysophyceae, seemed to dominate surface HF assemblages. The majority of these dominant HFs were present at relatively constant abundances, while others were influenced by temperature or displayed a patchy distribution. In the deep ocean, only a handful of taxa belonging to Bicosoecida and Chrysophyceae, together with Diplonemea and Kinetoplastida, explained most of the HF signal. Co‐occurrence networks between HF and prokaryotic taxa at the surface ocean revealed two main clusters influenced by temperature that did not seem to show specific patterns of interaction. However, some correlations emerged outside these thermal groups that could represent new prey–predator interactions. Overall, we identified the putatively most ecologically relevant HF taxa in the ocean, which become promising targets for further experimental and genomic studies.},
