abstract: Abstract Marine heterotrophic flagellates (HFs) form a diverse and ecologically
  relevant functional group of bacterial grazers and nutrient remineralizers in oceanic
  waters. Despite playing a crucial role in marine biogeochemical cycles, there is
  still a lack of information on which specific taxa dominate HF assemblages and what
  are their patterns of distribution in a global context. In the present work, we
  addressed this issue by analyzing amplicon sequencing data sets retrieved from samples
  taken in tropical and subtropical oceanic regions at depths from surface to 4000 m.
  Only a few dozens of widespread taxa, mostly affiliating to MAST clades, Picozoa,
  Bicosoecida and Chrysophyceae, seemed to dominate surface HF assemblages. The majority
  of these dominant HFs were present at relatively constant abundances, while others
  were influenced by temperature or displayed a patchy distribution. In the deep ocean,
  only a handful of taxa belonging to Bicosoecida and Chrysophyceae, together with
  Diplonemea and Kinetoplastida, explained most of the HF signal. Co‐occurrence networks
  between HF and prokaryotic taxa at the surface ocean revealed two main clusters
  influenced by temperature that did not seem to show specific patterns of interaction.
  However, some correlations emerged outside these thermal groups that could represent
  new prey–predator interactions. Overall, we identified the putatively most ecologically
  relevant HF taxa in the ocean, which become promising targets for further experimental
  and genomic studies.
