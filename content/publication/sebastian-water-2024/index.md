abstract: Due to the scarcity of organic matter (OM) sources in the bathypelagic (1000–4000
  m depth), prokaryotic metabolism is believed to be concentrated on particles originating
  from the surface. However, the structure of active bathypelagic prokaryotic communities
  and how it changes across environmental gradients remains unexplored. Using a combination
  of 16S rRNA gene and transcripts sequencing, metagenomics, and substrate uptake
  potential measurements, here we aimed to explore how water masses aging and the
  quality of OM influence the structure of the active microbiome, and the potential
  implications for community function. We found that the relative contribution of
  taxa with a free-living lifestyle to the active microbiome increased in older water
  masses that were enriched in recalcitrant OM, suggesting that these prokaryotes
  may also play a substantial role in the bathypelagic metabolism of vast areas of
  the ocean. In comparison to particle-associated prokaryotes, free-living prokaryotes
  exhibited lower potential metabolic rates, and harbored a limited number of two-component
  sensory systems, suggesting they have less ability to sense and respond to environmental
  cues. In contrast, particle-associated prokaryotes carried genes for particle colonization
  and carbohydrate utilization that were absent in prokaryotes with a free-living
  lifestyle. Consistently, we observed that prokaryotic communities inhabiting older
  waters displayed reduced abilities to colonize particles, and higher capabilities
  to use complex carbon sources, compared to communities in waters with a higher proportion
  of labile OM. Our results provide evidence of regionalization of the bathypelagic
  active prokaryotic microbiome, unveiling a niche partitioning based on the quality
  of OM.
