abstract: 'Abstract  Phytoplankton account for textgreater45% of global primary production,
  and have an enormous impact on aquatic food webs and on the entire Earth System.
  Their members are found among prokaryotes (cyanobacteria) and multiple eukaryotic
  lineages containing chloroplasts. Genetic surveys of phytoplankton communities generally
  consist of PCR amplification of bacterial (16S), nuclear (18S) and/or chloroplastic
  (16S) rRNA marker genes from DNA extracted from environmental samples. However,
  our appreciation of phytoplankton abundance or biomass is limited by PCR‐amplification
  biases, rRNA gene copy number variations across taxa, and the fact that rRNA genes
  do not provide insights into metabolic traits such as photosynthesis. Here, we targeted
  the photosynthetic gene psbO from metagenomes to circumvent these limitations: the
  method is PCR‐free, and the gene is universally and exclusively present in photosynthetic
  prokaryotes and eukaryotes, mainly in one copy per genome. We applied and validated
  this new strategy with the size‐fractionated marine samples collected by Tara Oceans,
  and showed improved correlations with flow cytometry and microscopy than when based
  on rRNA genes. Furthermore, we revealed unexpected features of the ecology of these
  ecosystems, such as the high abundance of picocyanobacterial aggregates and symbionts
  in the ocean, and the decrease in relative abundance of phototrophs towards the
  larger size classes of marine dinoflagellates. To facilitate the incorporation of
  psbO in molecular‐based surveys, we compiled a curated database of textgreater18,000
  unique sequences. Overall, psbO appears to be a promising new gene marker for molecular‐based
  evaluations of entire phytoplankton communities.  ,   see also the Perspective by
