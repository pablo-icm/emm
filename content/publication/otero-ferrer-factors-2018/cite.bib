effect of inorganic nutrients on planktonic assemblages has traditionally
relied on concentrations rather than estimates of nutrient supply. We
combined a novel dataset of hydrographic properties, turbulent mixing,
nutrient concentration, and picoplankton community composition with the aims
of (i) quantifying the role of temperature, light, and nitrate fluxes as
factors controlling the distribution of autotrophic and heterotrophic
picoplankton subgroups, as determined by flow cytometry, and (ii) describing
the ecological niches of the various components of the picoplankton
community. Data were collected at 97 stations in the Atlantic Ocean,
including tropical and subtropical open-ocean waters, the northwestern
Mediterranean Sea, and the Galician coastal upwelling system of the northwest
Iberian Peninsula. A generalized additive model (GAM) approach was used to
predict depth-integrated biomass of each picoplankton subgroup based on three
niche predictors: sea surface temperature, averaged daily surface irradiance,
and the transport of nitrate into the euphotic zone, through both diffusion
and advection. In addition, niche overlap among different picoplankton
subgroups was computed using nonparametric kernel density functions.
Temperature and nitrate supply were more relevant than light in predicting
the biomass of most picoplankton subgroups, except for
Prochlorococcus and low-nucleic-acid (LNA) prokaryotes, for which irradiance also played a
significant role. Nitrate supply was the only factor that allowed the
distinction among the ecological niches of all autotrophic and heterotrophic
picoplankton subgroups. Prochlorococcus and LNA prokaryotes were
more abundant in warmer waters (\textgreater20 ∘C) where the nitrate fluxes
were low, whereas Synechococcus and high-nucleic-acid (HNA)
prokaryotes prevailed mainly in cooler environments characterized by
intermediate or high levels of nitrate supply. Finally, the niche of
picoeukaryotes was defined by low temperatures and high nitrate supply. These
results support the key role of nitrate supply, as it not only promotes the
growth of large phytoplankton, but it also controls the structure of marine
picoplankton communities.},
