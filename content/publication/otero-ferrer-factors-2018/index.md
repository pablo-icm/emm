abstract: 'Abstract. The effect of inorganic nutrients on planktonic assemblages has
  traditionally relied on concentrations rather than estimates of nutrient supply.
  We combined a novel dataset of hydrographic properties, turbulent mixing, nutrient
  concentration, and picoplankton community composition with the aims of (i) quantifying
  the role of temperature, light, and nitrate fluxes as factors controlling the distribution
  of autotrophic and heterotrophic picoplankton subgroups, as determined by flow cytometry,
  and (ii) describing the ecological niches of the various components of the picoplankton
  community. Data were collected at 97 stations in the Atlantic Ocean, including tropical
  and subtropical open-ocean waters, the northwestern Mediterranean Sea, and the Galician
  coastal upwelling system of the northwest Iberian Peninsula. A generalized additive
  model (GAM) approach was used to predict depth-integrated biomass of each picoplankton
  subgroup based on three niche predictors: sea surface temperature, averaged daily
  surface irradiance, and the transport of nitrate into the euphotic zone, through
  both diffusion and advection. In addition, niche overlap among different picoplankton
  subgroups was computed using nonparametric kernel density functions. Temperature
  and nitrate supply were more relevant than light in predicting the biomass of most
  picoplankton subgroups, except for Prochlorococcus and low-nucleic-acid (LNA) prokaryotes,
  for which irradiance also played a significant role. Nitrate supply was the only
  factor that allowed the distinction among the ecological niches of all autotrophic
  and heterotrophic picoplankton subgroups. Prochlorococcus and LNA prokaryotes were
  more abundant in warmer waters (textgreater20 ∘C) where the nitrate fluxes were
  low, whereas Synechococcus and high-nucleic-acid (HNA) prokaryotes prevailed mainly
  in cooler environments characterized by intermediate or high levels of nitrate supply.
  Finally, the niche of picoeukaryotes was defined by low temperatures and high nitrate
  supply. These results support the key role of nitrate supply, as it not only promotes
  the growth of large phytoplankton, but it also controls the structure of marine
  picoplankton communities.'
