abstract: ABSTRACT  An understanding of the distribution of colored dissolved organic
  matter (CDOM) in the oceans and its role in the global carbon cycle requires a better
  knowledge of the colored materials produced and consumed by marine phytoplankton
  and bacteria. In this work, we examined the net uptake and release of CDOM by a
  natural bacterial community growing on DOM derived from four phytoplankton species
  cultured under axenic conditions. Fluorescent humic-like substances exuded by phytoplankton
  (excitation/emission [Ex/Em] wavelength, 310 nm/392 nm; Coble's peak M) were utilized
  by bacteria in different proportions depending on the phytoplankton species of origin.
  Furthermore, bacteria produced humic-like substances that fluoresce at an Ex/Em
  wavelength of 340 nm/440 nm (Coble's peak C). Differences were also observed in
  the Ex/Em wavelengths of the protein-like materials (Coble's peak T) produced by
  phytoplankton and bacteria. The induced fluorescent emission of CDOM produced by
  prokaryotes was an order of magnitude higher than that of CDOM produced by eukaryotes.
  We have also examined the final compositions of the bacterial communities growing
  on the exudates, which differed markedly depending on the phytoplankton species
  of origin. Alteromonas and Roseobacter were dominant during all the incubations
  on Chaetoceros sp. and Prorocentrum minimum exudates, respectively. Alteromonas
  was the dominant group growing on Skeletonema costatum exudates during the exponential
  growth phase, but it was replaced by Roseobacter afterwards. On Micromonas pusilla
  exudates, Roseobacter was replaced by Bacteroidetes after the exponential growth
  phase. Our work shows that fluorescence excitation-emission matrices of CDOM can
  be a helpful tool for the identification of microbial sources of DOM in the marine
  environment, but further studies are necessary to explore the association of particular
  bacterial groups with specific fluorophores.
