abstract: 'Our pigment analyses from a year‐long study in the coastal Beaufort Sea
  in the western Canadian Arctic showed the continuous prevalence of eukaryotic picoplankton
  in the green algal class Prasinophyceae. Microscopic analyses revealed that the
  most abundant photosynthetic cell types were Micromonas ‐like picoprasinophytes
  that persisted throughout winter darkness and then maintained steady exponential
  growth from late winter to early summer. A Micromonas (CCMP2099) isolated from an
  Arctic polynya (North Water Polynya between Ellesmere Island and Greenland), an
  ice‐free section, grew optimally at 6°C–8°C, with light saturation at or below 10 μmol
  photons·m −2 ·s −1 at 0°C. The 18S rDNA analyses of this isolate and environmental
  DNA clone libraries from diverse sites across the Arctic Basin indicate that this
  single psychrophilic Micromonas ecotype has a pan‐Arctic distribution. The 18S rDNA
  from two other picoprasinophyte genera was also found in our pan‐Arctic clone libraries:
  Bathycoccus and Mantoniella . The Arctic Micromonas differed from genotypes elsewhere
  in the World Ocean, implying that the Arctic Basin is a marine microbial province
  containing endemic species, consistent with the biogeography of its macroorganisms.
  The prevalence of obligate low‐temperature, shade‐adapted species in the phytoplankton
  indicates that the lower food web of the Arctic Ocean is vulnerable to ongoing climate
  change in the region.'
