abstract: Abstract In this work, we study the diversity of bathypelagic microbial
  eukaryotes (0.8–20 μm) in the global ocean. Seawater samples from 3000 to 4000 m
  depth from 27 stations in the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian Oceans were analyzed
  by pyrosequencing the V4 region of the 18S ribosomal DNA. The relative abundance
  of the most abundant operational taxonomic units agreed with the results of a parallel
  metagenomic analysis, suggesting limited PCR biases in the tag approach. Although
  rarefaction curves for single stations were seldom saturated, the global analysis
  of all sequences together suggested an adequate recovery of bathypelagic diversity.
  Community composition presented a large variability among samples, which was poorly
  explained by linear geographic distance. In fact, the similarity between communities
  was better explained by water mass composition (26% of the variability) and the
  ratio in cell abundance between prokaryotes and microbial eukaryotes (21%). Deep
  diversity appeared dominated by four taxonomic groups (Collodaria, Chrysophytes,
  Basidiomycota and MALV-II) appearing in different proportions in each sample. Novel
  diversity amounted to 1% of the pyrotags and was lower than expected. Our study
  represents an essential step in the investigation of bathypelagic microbial eukaryotes,
  indicating dominating taxonomic groups and suggesting idiosyncratic assemblages
  in distinct oceanic regions.
