abstract: Summary The bathypelagic ocean is one of the largest ecosystems on Earth
  and sustains half of the ocean's microbial activity. This microbial activity strongly
  relies on surface‐derived particles, but there is growing evidence that the carbon
  released through solubilization of these particles may not be sufficient to meet
  the energy demands of deep ocean prokaryotes. To explore how bathypelagic prokaryotes
  respond to the absence of external inputs of carbon, we followed the long‐term (1 year)
  dynamics of an enclosed community. Despite the lack of external energy supply, we
  observed a continuous succession of active prokaryotic phylotypes, which was driven
  by recruitment of taxa from the seed bank (i.e., initially rare operational taxonomic
  units [OTUs]). A single OTU belonging to Marine Group I of Thaumarchaeota, which
  was originally rare, dominated the microbial community for ∼ 4 months and played
  a fundamental role in this succession likely by introducing new organic carbon through
  chemolithoautotrophy. This carbon presumably produced a priming effect, because
  after the decline of Thaumarchaeota, the diversity and metabolic potential of the
  community increased back to the levels present at the start of the experiment. Our
  study demonstrates the profound versatility of deep microbial communities when facing
  organic carbon deprivation.
