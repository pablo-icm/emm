abstract: Prochlorococcus is a key member of open-ocean primary producer communities.
  Despite its importance, little is known about the predators that consume this cyanobacterium
  and make its biomass available to higher trophic levels. We identify potential predators
  along a gradient wherein Prochlorococcus abundance increased from near detection
  limits (coastal California) to textgreater200,000 cells mL âˆ’1 (subtropical North
  Pacific Gyre). A replicated RNA-Stable Isotope Probing experiment involving the
  in situ community, and labeled Prochlorococcus as prey, revealed choanoflagellates
  as the most active predators of Prochlorococcus , alongside a radiolarian, chrysophytes,
  dictyochophytes, and specific MAST lineages. These predators were not appropriately
  highlighted in multiyear conventional 18S rRNA gene amplicon surveys where dinoflagellates
  and other taxa had highest relative amplicon abundances across the gradient. In
  identifying direct consumers of Prochlorococcus , we reveal food-web linkages of
  individual protistan taxa and resolve routes of carbon transfer from the base of
  marine food webs.
