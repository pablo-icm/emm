abstract: Studies based on protein-coding genes are essential to describe the diversity
  within bacterial functional groups. In the case of aerobic anoxygenic phototrophic
  (AAP) bacteria, the pufM gene has been established as the genetic marker for this
  particular functional group, although available primers are known to have amplification
  biases. We review here the existing primers for pufM gene amplification, design
  new ones, and evaluate their phylogenetic coverage. We then use samples from contrasting
  marine environments to evaluate their performance. By comparing the taxonomic composition
  of communities retrieved with metagenomics and with different amplicon approaches,
  we show that the commonly used PCR primers are biased towards the Gammaproteobacteria
  phylum and some Alphaproteobacteria clades. The metagenomic approach, as well as
  the use of other combinations of the existing and newly designed primers, show that
  these groups are in fact less abundant than previously observed, and that a great
  proportion of pufM sequences are affiliated to uncultured representatives, particularly
  in the open ocean. Altogether, the framework developed here becomes a better alternative
  for future studies based on the pufM gene and, additionally, serves as a reference
  for primer evaluation of other functional genes.
