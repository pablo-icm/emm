abstract: The literature proposes that bacterial abundance (BA) and heterotrophic
  nanoflagellates abundance (HNFA) are positively related across different aquatic
  systems, suggesting a strong resource control of HNFA and predatory control of BA.
  To test this proposed pattern, we collected published and unpublished data and analyzed
  trends across lakes, rivers, marine, and benthic samples. BA varied between 10 5
  and 10 11 cells ml −1 , while HNFA ranged from 10 2 to 10 6 cells ml −1 . The relationship
  was stronger in systems with low bacterial abundances and weaker in the most bacteria‐rich
  systems. When data were averaged per study or per system we detected a trend with
  trophy, with highest HNFA in benthic systems followed by lakes and coastal areas
  of the sea, and lowest abundances in rivers and the open ocean. This relationship
  was improved in lakes, where cladoceran abundance was negatively related to HNFA.
  The effect of cladocerans was stronger in lakes where Daphnia spp. dominated. The
  weak pattern observed between BA and HNFA across systems suggests that several factors
  (resources, predators, environment, etc.) are acting differently on BA and HNFA.
  Changes in population abundances of bacteria and heterotrophic nanoflagellates are
  mainly determined by nutrient supply and grazing, and also by complex trophic interactions
  with numerous feedbacks. Empirical relationships between BA and HNFA across systems
  can only partially explain these changes in terms of predator‐prey dependence.
