The stramenopiles are a large and diverse group of eukaryotes that possess various lifestyles required to thrive in a broad array of environments. The stramenopiles branch with the alveolates, rhizarians, and telonemids, forming the supergroup TSAR. Here, we present a new genus and species of aquatic nanoflagellated stramenopile:
Mediocremonas mediterraneus
, a free‐swimming heterotrophic predator.
M
.
mediterraneus
cell bodies measure between 2.0–4.0 μm in length and 1.2–3.7 μm in width, possessing two flagella and an oval body morphology. The growth and grazing rate of
M
.
mediterraneus
in batch cultures ranges from 0.68 to 1.83 d
−1
and 1.99 to 5.38 bacteria/h, respectively.
M
.
mediterraneus
was found to be 93.9% phylogenetically similar with
Developayella elegans
and 94.7% with
Develorapax marinus
, two members within the class Developea. The phylogenetic position of the Developea and the ability of
M
.
mediterraneus
to remain in culture make it a good candidate for further genomic studies that could help us to better understand phagotrophy in marine systems as well as the transition from heterotrophy to phototrophy within the stramenopiles.},
