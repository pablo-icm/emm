abstract: Summary  Photosynthetic microorganisms play a crucial role in the marine
  environment. In vast areas of the oceans, marine primary productivity is performed
  by cells smaller than 2–3 µm (picoplankton). Here, we report on molecular analyses
  of the conserved photosynthetic psbA gene (coding for protein D1 of photosystem
  II reaction centre) as a diversity indicator of naturally occurring marine oxygenic
  picophytoplankton. The psbA genes proved to be good indicators of the presence of
  a wide variety of photosynthetic marine microbial groups, including new cyanobacterial
  groups and eukaryotic algae (prasinophytes). Furthermore, using environmental bacterial
  artificial chromosome (BAC) libraries, we were able to correlate psbA genes with
  small subunit rRNAs and, therefore, to confirm their phylogenetic affiliation.
