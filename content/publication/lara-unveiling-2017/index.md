abstract: Viral activity exerts a particularly important role in the dark ocean across
  the global tropical and subtropical oceans. ,   Viruses are a key component of marine
  ecosystems, but the assessment of their global role in regulating microbial communities
  and the flux of carbon is precluded by a paucity of data, particularly in the deep
  ocean. We assessed patterns in viral abundance and production and the role of viral
  lysis as a driver of prokaryote mortality, from surface to bathypelagic layers,
  across the tropical and subtropical oceans. Viral abundance showed significant differences
  between oceans in the epipelagic and mesopelagic, but not in the bathypelagic, and
  decreased with depth, with an average power-law scaling exponent of −1.03 km −1
  from an average of 7.76 × 10 6 viruses ml −1 in the epipelagic to 0.62 × 10 6 viruses
  ml −1 in the bathypelagic layer with an average integrated (0 to 4000 m) viral stock
  of about 0.004 to 0.044 g C m −2 , half of which is found below 775 m. Lysogenic
  viral production was higher than lytic viral production in surface waters, whereas
  the opposite was found in the bathypelagic, where prokaryotic mortality due to viruses
  was estimated to be 60 times higher than grazing. Free viruses had turnover times
  of 0.1 days in the bathypelagic, revealing that viruses in the bathypelagic are
  highly dynamic. On the basis of the rates of lysed prokaryotic cells, we estimated
  that viruses release 145 Gt C year −1 in the global tropical and subtropical oceans.
  The active viral processes reported here demonstrate the importance of viruses in
  the production of dissolved organic carbon in the dark ocean, a major pathway in
  carbon cycling.
