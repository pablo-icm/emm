abstract: Summary  The abundance and diversity of aerobic anoxygenic phototrophs (
  AAPs ) were studied for a year cycle at the B lanes B ay M icrobial O bservatory
  ( NW M editerranean) and their potential links to an array of environmental variables
  were explored. Cell numbers were low in winter and peaked in summer, showing a marked
  seasonality that positively correlated with day length and light at the surface.
  Bacteriochlorophyll a concentration, their light‚Äêharvesting pigment, was only detected
  between A pril and O ctober, and pigment cell quota showed large variations during
  this period. Pyrosequencing analysis of the  puf M  gene revealed that the most
  abundant operational taxonomic units ( OTU s) were affiliated to phylogroup K (  G
  ammaproteobacteria  ) and uncultured phylogroup C , although they were outnumbered
  by alphaproteobacterial OTU s in spring. Overall, richness was higher in winter
  than in summer, showing an opposite trend to abundance and day length. Clustering
  of samples by multivariate analyses showed a clear seasonality that suggests a succession
  of different AAP subpopulations over time. Temperature, chlorophyll a and day length
  were the environmental drivers that best explained the distribution of AAP assemblages.
  These results indicate that AAP bacteria are highly dynamic and undergo seasonal
  variations in diversity and abundance mostly dictated by environmental conditions
  as exemplified by light availability.
