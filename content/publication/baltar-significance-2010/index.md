abstract: It is generally assumed that sinking particulate organic carbon (POC) constitutes
  the main source of organic carbon supply to the deep ocean's food webs. However,
  a major discrepancy between the rates of sinking POC supply (collected with sediment
  traps) and the prokaryotic organic carbon demand (the total amount of carbon required
  to sustain the heterotrophic metabolism of the prokaryotes; i.e., production plus
  respiration, PCD) of deep‐water communities has been consistently reported for the
  dark realm of the global ocean. While the amount of sinking POC flux declines exponentially
  with depth, the concentration of suspended, buoyant non‐sinking POC (nsPOC; obtained
  with oceanographic bottles) exhibits only small variations with depth in the (sub)tropical
  Northeast Atlantic. Based on available data for the North Atlantic we show here
  that the sinking POC flux would contribute only 4–12% of the PCD in the mesopelagic
  realm (depending on the primary production rate in surface waters). The amount of
  nsPOC potentially available to heterotrophic prokaryotes in the mesopelagic realm
  can be partly replenished by dark dissolved inorganic carbon fixation contributing
  between 12% to 72% to the PCD daily. Taken together, there is evidence that the
  mesopelagic microheterotrophic biota is more dependent on the nsPOC pool than on
  the sinking POC supply. Hence, the enigmatic major mismatch between the organic
  carbon demand of the deep‐water heterotrophic microbiota and the POC supply rates
  might be substantially smaller by including the potentially available nsPOC and
  its autochthonous production in oceanic carbon cycling models.
