abstract: 'Significance The oceans are populated by an astronomical number of predominantly
  uncultured microbes, which altogether guarantee ecosystem function. Unicellular
  eukaryotic predators represent basal links in marine food webs and have so far been
  predominantly characterized as a functional group, despite having different ecologies
  and evolutionary histories. In order to better understand the ecoevolution of the
  ocean’s smallest predators, we have investigated four species belonging to an uncultured
  cosmopolitan family: marine stramenopiles (MAST)-4. Using state-of-the-art single-cell
  genomics and metaomics approaches, we found that members of this predatory family
  have different distributions in the surface ocean and different genes to degrade
  food, which likely represent niche adaptations. Our work highlights the importance
  of understanding the species-level ecology and genomics of tiny ocean predators.
  ,  Unicellular eukaryotic predators play a crucial role in the functioning of the
  ocean ecosystem by recycling nutrients and energy that are channeled to upper trophic
  levels. Traditionally, these evolutionarily diverse organisms have been combined
  into a single functional group (heterotrophic flagellates), overlooking their organismal
  differences. Here, we investigated four evolutionarily related species belonging
  to one cosmopolitan group of uncultured marine picoeukaryotic predators: marine
  stramenopiles (MAST)-4 (species A, B, C, and E). Co-occurrence and distribution
  analyses in the global surface ocean indicated contrasting patterns in MAST-4A and
  C, suggesting adaptation to different temperatures. We then investigated whether
  these spatial distribution patterns were mirrored by MAST-4 genomic content using
  single-cell genomics. Analyses of 69 single cells recovered 66 to 83% of the MAST-4A/B/C/E
  genomes, which displayed substantial interspecies divergence. MAST-4 genomes were
  similar in terms of broad gene functional categories, but they differed in enzymes
  of ecological relevance, such as glycoside hydrolases (GHs), which are part of the
  food degradation machinery in MAST-4. Interestingly, MAST-4 species featuring a
  similar GH composition (A and C) coexcluded each other in the surface global ocean,
  while species with a different set of GHs (B and C) appeared to be able to coexist,
  suggesting further niche diversification associated with prey digestion. We propose
  that differential niche adaptation to temperature and prey type has promoted adaptive
  evolutionary diversification in MAST-4. We show that minute ocean predators from
  the same phylogenetic group may have different biogeography and genomic content,
  which needs to be accounted for to better comprehend marine food webs.'
