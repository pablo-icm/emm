abstract: Abstract Upon phosphorus (P) deficiency, marine phytoplankton reduce their
  requirements for P by replacing membrane phospholipids with alternative non-phosphorus
  lipids. It was very recently demonstrated that a SAR11 isolate also shares this
  capability when phosphate starved in culture. Yet, the extent to which this process
  occurs in other marine heterotrophic bacteria and in the natural environment is
  unknown. Here, we demonstrate that the substitution of membrane phospholipids for
  a variety of non-phosphorus lipids is a conserved response to P deficiency among
  phylogenetically diverse marine heterotrophic bacteria, including members of the
  Alphaproteobacteria and Flavobacteria. By deletion mutagenesis and complementation
  in the model marine bacterium Phaeobacter sp. MED193 and heterologous expression
  in recombinant Escherichia coli, we confirm the roles of a phospholipase C (PlcP)
  and a glycosyltransferase in lipid remodelling. Analyses of the Global Ocean Sampling
  and Tara Oceans metagenome data sets demonstrate that PlcP is particularly abundant
  in areas characterized by low phosphate concentrations. Furthermore, we show that
  lipid remodelling occurs seasonally and responds to changing nutrient conditions
  in natural microbial communities from the Mediterranean Sea. Together, our results
  point to the key role of lipid substitution as an adaptive strategy enabling heterotrophic
  bacteria to thrive in the vast P-depleted areas of the ocean.
