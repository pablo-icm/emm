abstract: 'Abstract  Background  The ocean microbiota modulates global biogeochemical
  cycles and changes in its configuration may have large-scale consequences. Yet,
  the underlying ecological mechanisms structuring it are unclear. Here, we investigate
  how fundamental ecological mechanisms ( selection , dispersal and ecological drift
  ) shape the smallest members of the tropical and subtropical surface-ocean microbiota:
  prokaryotes and minute eukaryotes (picoeukaryotes). Furthermore, we investigate
  the agents exerting abiotic selection on this assemblage as well as the spatial
  patterns emerging from the action of ecological mechanisms. To explore this, we
  analysed the composition of surface-ocean prokaryotic and picoeukaryotic communities
  using DNA-sequence data (16S- and 18S-rRNA genes) collected during the circumglobal
  expeditions Malaspina - 2010 and TARA - Oceans .    Results  We found that the two
  main components of the tropical and subtropical surface-ocean microbiota, prokaryotes
  and picoeukaryotes, appear to be structured by different ecological mechanisms.
  Picoeukaryotic communities were predominantly structured by dispersal-limitation,
  while prokaryotic counterparts appeared to be shaped by the combined action of dispersal-limitation,
  selection and drift. Temperature-driven selection appeared as a major factor, out
  of a few selected factors, influencing species co-occurrence networks in prokaryotes
  but not in picoeukaryotes, indicating that association patterns may contribute to
  understand ocean microbiota structure and response to selection. Other measured
  abiotic variables seemed to have limited selective effects on community structure
  in the tropical and subtropical ocean. Picoeukaryotes displayed a higher spatial
  differentiation between communities and a higher distance decay when compared to
  prokaryotes, consistent with a scenario of higher dispersal limitation in the former
  after considering environmental heterogeneity. Lastly, random dynamics or drift
  seemed to have a more important role in structuring prokaryotic communities than
  picoeukaryotic counterparts.    Conclusions The differential action of ecological
  mechanisms seems to cause contrasting biogeography, in the tropical and subtropical
  ocean, among the smallest surface plankton, prokaryotes and picoeukaryotes. This
  suggests that the idiosyncrasy of the main constituents of the ocean microbiota
  should be considered in order to understand its current and future configuration,
  which is especially relevant in a context of global change, where the reaction of
  surface ocean plankton to temperature increase is still unclear.'
