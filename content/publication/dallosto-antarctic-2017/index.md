abstract: Abstract Climate warming affects the development and distribution of sea
  ice, but at present the evidence of polar ecosystem feedbacks on climate through
  changes in the atmosphere is sparse. By means of synergistic atmospheric and oceanic
  measurements in the Southern Ocean near Antarctica, we present evidence that the
  microbiota of sea ice and sea ice-influenced ocean are a previously unknown significant
  source of atmospheric organic nitrogen, including low molecular weight alkyl-amines.
  Given the keystone role of nitrogen compounds in aerosol formation, growth and neutralization,
  our findings call for greater chemical and source diversity in the modelling efforts
  linking the marine ecosystem to aerosol-mediated climate effects in the Southern
  Ocean.
