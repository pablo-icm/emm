abstract: Abstract Although animals are among the best studied organisms, we still
  lack a full description of their diversity, especially for microscopic taxa. This
  is partly due to the time-consuming and costly nature of surveying animal diversity
  through morphological and molecular studies of individual taxa. A powerful alternative
  is the use of high-throughput environmental sequencing, providing molecular data
  from all organisms sampled. We here address the unknown diversity of animal phyla
  in marine environments using an extensive dataset designed to assess eukaryotic
  ribosomal diversity among European coastal locations. A multi-phylum assessment
  of marine animal diversity that includes water column and sediments, oxic and anoxic
  environments, and both DNA and RNA templates, revealed a high percentage of novel
  18S rRNA sequences in most phyla, suggesting that marine environments have not yet
  been fully sampled at a molecular level. This novelty is especially high among Platyhelminthes,
  Acoelomorpha, and Nematoda, which are well studied from a morphological perspective
  and abundant in benthic environments. We also identified, based on molecular data,
  a potentially novel group of widespread tunicates. Moreover, we recovered a high
  number of reads for Ctenophora and Cnidaria in the smaller fractions suggesting
  their gametes might play a greater ecological role than previously suspected.
