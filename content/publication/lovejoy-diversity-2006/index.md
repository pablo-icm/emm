abstract: ABSTRACT  We analyzed microbial eukaryote diversity in perennially cold
  arctic marine waters by using 18S rRNA gene clone libraries. Samples were collected
  during concurrent oceanographic missions to opposite sides of the Arctic Ocean Basin
  and encompassed five distinct water masses. Two deep water Arctic Ocean sites and
  the convergence of the Greenland, Norwegian, and Barents Seas were sampled from
  28 August to 2 September 2002. An additional sample was obtained from the Beaufort
  Sea (Canada) in early October 2002. The ribotypes were diverse, with different communities
  among sites and between the upper mixed layer and just below the halocline. Eukaryotes
  from the remote Canada Basin contained new phylotypes belonging to the radiolarian
  orders Acantharea, Polycystinea, and Taxopodida. A novel group within the photosynthetic
  stramenopiles was also identified. One sample closest to the interior of the Canada
  Basin yielded only four major taxa, and all but two of the sequences recovered belonged
  to the polar diatom Fragilariopsis and a radiolarian. Overall, 42% of the sequences
  were textless98% similar to any sequences in GenBank. Moreover, 15% of these were
  textless95% similar to previously recovered sequences, which is indicative of endemic
  or undersampled taxa in the North Polar environment. The cold, stable Arctic Ocean
  is a threatened environment, and climate change could result in significant loss
  of global microbial biodiversity.
