abstract: Abstract  Dimethylsulfide (DMS) is a biogenic gas with potential climatic
  effects, and its marine emission depends on the interplay between microbial activity
  and physical forcing in the oceanic upper mixed layer. We investigated the diel
  cycling patterns of DMS and its precursor dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) in four
  experiments (28 to 48 h long) performed in mesotrophic to ultraoligotrophic Mediterranean
  and Sargasso Sea waters. Samples taken every 4 or 6 h were analyzed for dimethylated
  sulfur pools and incubated to measure DMS and DMSP cycling rates, as well as primary
  and bacterial production. In all four experiments, DMS budgets showed pronounced
  day versus night variability. In the three summer experiments, gross community DMS
  production (GP DMS ) increased by twofold to threefold from nighttime to daytime,
  peaking 0–4 h after solar noon. This excess GP DMS was balanced by higher photochemical
  and microbial sinks during the day, effectively buffering DMS concentrations. In
  the only winter experiment, GP DMS exhibited opposed temporal dynamics and peaked
  at nighttime in parallel to total DMSP consumption. Community DMSP to DMS conversion
  yields were generally textless10% throughout the winter experiment and at night
  in summer, and increased to textgreater15% (even textgreater50%) during the day
  in summer, presumably due to phytoplankton radiative stress. Our data suggest that
  (1) diel variability should be taken into account in process studies, diagnostic,
  and prognostic models of DMS cycling and (2) the community DMS yield is a key variable
  that defines characteristic DMS cycling regimes.  ,  Key Points    Biological DMS
  and DMSP cycling processes show pronounced diel variability   Sunlight drives DMSP
  to DMS conversion yields during summer stratification   Diel variability should
  be taken into account in oceanic DMS cycling budgets
