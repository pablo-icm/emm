abstract: Abstract Surveying microbial diversity and function is accomplished by combining
  complementary molecular tools. Among them, metagenomics is a PCR free approach that
  contains all genetic information from microbial assemblages and is today performed
  at a relatively large scale and reasonable cost, mostly based on very short reads.
  Here, we investigated the potential of metagenomics to provide taxonomic reports
  of marine microbial eukaryotes. We prepared a curated database with reference sequences
  of the V4 region of 18S rDNA clustered at 97% similarity and used this database
  to extract and classify metagenomic reads. More than half of them were unambiguously
  affiliated to a unique reference whilst the rest could be assigned to a given taxonomic
  group. The overall diversity reported by metagenomics was similar to that obtained
  by amplicon sequencing of the V4 and V9 regions of the 18S rRNA gene, although either
  one or both of these amplicon surveys performed poorly for groups like Excavata,
  Amoebozoa, Fungi and Haptophyta. We then studied the diversity of picoeukaryotes
  and nanoeukaryotes using 91 metagenomes from surface down to bathypelagic layers
  in different oceans, unveiling a clear taxonomic separation between size fractions
  and depth layers. Finally, we retrieved long rDNA sequences from assembled metagenomes
  that improved phylogenetic reconstructions of particular groups. Overall, this study
  shows metagenomics as an excellent resource for taxonomic exploration of marine
  microbial eukaryotes.
