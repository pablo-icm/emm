abstract: Abstract  Estimation of prokaryotic growth rates is critical to understand
  the ecological role and contribution of different microbes to marine biogeochemical
  cycles. However, there is a general lack of knowledge on what factors control the
  growth rates of different prokaryotic groups and how these vary between sites and
  along seasons at a given site. We carried out several manipulation experiments during
  the four astronomical seasons in the coastal NW Mediterranean in order to evaluate
  the impact of grazing, viral mortality, resource competition and light on the growth
  and loss rates of prokaryotes. Gross and net growth rates of different bacterioplankton
  groups targeted by group-specific CARD-FISH probes and infrared microscopy (for
  aerobic anoxygenic phototrophs, AAP), were calculated from changes in cell abundances.
  Maximal group-specific growth rates were achieved when both predation pressure and
  nutrient limitation were experimentally minimized, while only a minimal effect of
  viral pressure on growth rates was observed; nevertheless, the response to predation
  removal was more remarkable in winter, when the bacterial community was not subjected
  to nutrient limitation. Although all groups showed increases in their growth rates
  when resource competition as well as grazers and viral pressure were reduced, Alteromonadaceae
  consistently presented the highest rates in all seasons. The response to light availability
  was generally weaker than that to the other factors, but it was variable between
  seasons. In summer and spring, the growth rates of AAP were stimulated by light
  whereas the growth of the SAR11 clade (likely containing proteorhodopsin) was enhanced
  by light in all seasons. Overall, our results set thresholds on bacterioplankton
  group-specific growth and mortality rates and contribute to estimate the seasonally
  changing contribution of various bacterioplankton groups to the function of microbial
  communities. Our results also indicate that the least abundant groups display the
  highest growth rates, contributing to the recycling of organic matter to a much
  greater extent than what their abundances alone would predict.
