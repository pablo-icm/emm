abstract: ABSTRACT  A previous report of high levels of members of the domain Archaea
  in Antarctic coastal waters prompted us to investigate the ecology of Antarctic
  planktonic prokaryotes. rRNA hybridization techniques and denaturing gradient gel
  electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis of the bacterial V3 region were used to study variation
  in Antarctic picoplankton assemblages. In Anvers Island nearshore waters during
  late winter to early spring, the amounts of archaeal rRNA ranged from 17.1 to 3.6%
  of the total picoplankton rRNA in 1996 and from 16.0 to 1.0% of the total rRNA in
  1995. Offshore in the Palmer Basin, the levels of archaeal rRNA throughout the water
  column were higher (average, 24% of the total rRNA) during the same period in 1996.
  The archaeal rRNA levels in nearshore waters followed a highly seasonal pattern
  and markedly decreased during the austral summer at two stations. There was a significant
  negative correlation between archaeal rRNA levels and phytoplankton levels (as inferred
  from chlorophyll a concentrations) in nearshore surface waters during the early
  spring of 1995 and during an 8-month period in 1996 and 1997. In situ hybridization
  experiments revealed that 5 to 14% of DAPI (4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole)-stained
  cells were archaeal, corresponding to 0.9 × 10 4 to 2.7 × 10 4 archaeal cells per
  ml, in late winter 1996 samples. Analysis of bacterial ribosomal DNA fragments by
  DGGE revealed that the assemblage composition may reflect changes in water column
  stability, depth, or season. The data indicate that changes in Antarctic seasons
  are accompanied by significant shifts in the species composition of bacterioplankton
  assemblages and by large decreases in the relative proportion of archaeal rRNA in
  the nearshore water column.
