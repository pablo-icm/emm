abstract: ABSTRACT  We analyzed the contributions of different heterotrophic bacterial
  groups to the uptake of several low-molecular weight compounds during a seasonal
  cycle on the northwestern Mediterranean coast (Blanes Bay Microbial Observatory).
  The bacterial assemblage structure had been shown to change substantially year-round
  for this site, but whether changes in the activities of the different bacterial
  groups also occurred on the seasonal scale was unknown. Microautoradiography combined
  with catalyzed reporter deposition fluorescence in situ hybridization was used to
  analyze the patterns of glucose, amino acid, and ATP uptake by different bacterial
  groups. Gammaproteobacteria and Bacteroidetes were not very active in the uptake
  of glucose at any time of the year (textless10% of cells were active) compared to
  Alphaproteobacteria (generally textgreater20% of cells were active). Dissolved free
  amino acids were taken up considerably by Alphaproteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria
  but not by Bacteroidetes . Relatively high percentages of cells of the three broad
  phylogenetic groups actively took up ATP, which could be related to the important
  phosphorous limitation of bacterial production during most of the year in Blanes
  Bay. The contribution of SAR11 to the uptake of the monomers was variable year-round,
  generally with fewer than 30% of the cells being active. By contrast, Roseobacter
  were highly overrepresented in the uptake of all the substrates throughout all the
  year, with more than 50% of cells being active in all the samples and for all substrates.
  Our results suggest that substantial changes in the activity of some phylogenetic
  groups of bacteria occur throughout the year.
