abstract: Abstract  The Senegalese sole ( Solea senegalensis ) is a marine flatfish
  of high economic value and a target species for aquaculture. The efforts to reproduce
  this species in captivity have been hampered by the fact that farmed males (F1)
  often show lower sperm production and fertilization capacity than wild‐type males
  (F0). Our knowledge on spermatogenesis is however limited to a few studies. In a
  previous work, we identified by 2‐D DIGE several potential protein markers in testis
  for the poor reproductive performance of F1 males. Therefore, the objectives of
  the present study were, first, to investigate changes in genes and proteins expressed
  in the testis throughout spermatogenesis in F0 males by using a combination of transcriptomic
  and proteomic approaches and, second, to further compare the testis proteome between
  late spermatogenic stages of F0 and F1 fish to identify potential indicators of
  hampered reproductive performance in F1 fish. We identified approximately 400 genes
  and 49 proteins that are differentially expressed during the progression of spermatogenesis
  and that participate in processes such as transcriptional activation, the ubiquitin–proteasome
  system, sperm maturation and motility or cytoskeletal remodeling. Interestingly,
  a number of these proteins differed in abundance between F0 and F1 fish, pointing
  toward alterations in cytoskeleton, sperm motility, the ubiquitin–proteasome system
  and the redox state during spermiogenesis as possible causes for the decreased fertility
  of F1 fish.
