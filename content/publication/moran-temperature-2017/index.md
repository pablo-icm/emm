abstract: Abstract  Planktonic heterotrophic prokaryotes make up the largest living
  biomass and process most organic matter in the ocean. Determining when and where
  the biomass and activity of heterotrophic prokaryotes are controlled by resource
  availability (bottom‐up), predation and viral lysis (top‐down) or temperature will
  help in future carbon cycling predictions. We conducted an extensive survey across
  subtropical and tropical waters of the Atlantic, Indian and Pacific Oceans during
  the Malaspina 2010 Global Circumnavigation Expedition and assessed indices for these
  three types of controls at 109 stations (mostly from the surface to 4,000 m depth).
  Temperature control was approached by the apparent activation energy in eV (ranging
  from 0.46 to 3.41), bottom‐up control by the slope of the log‐log relationship between
  biomass and production rate (ranging from −0.12 to 1.09) and top‐down control by
  an index that considers the relative abundances of heterotrophic nanoflagellates
  and viruses (ranging from 0.82 to 4.83). We conclude that temperature becomes dominant
  (i.e. activation energy textgreater1.5  eV ) within a narrow window of intermediate
  values of bottom‐up (0.3–0.6) and top‐down 0.8–1.2) controls. A pervasive latitudinal
  pattern of decreasing temperature regulation towards the Equator, regardless of
  the oceanic basin, suggests that the impact of global warming on marine microbes
  and their biogeochemical function will be more intense at higher latitudes. Our
  analysis predicts that 1°C ocean warming will result in increased biomass of heterotrophic
  prokaryoplankton only in waters with textless26°C of mean annual surface temperature.
