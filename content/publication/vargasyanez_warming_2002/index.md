abstract: "Temperature time series from 1992 to 2001 (ECOMÁLAGA Project), show an intense warming trend in deep layers (200m depth) of Málaga Bay (0.02°C/yr). Data from MEDATLAS show that this trend is 0.005°C/yr throughout the whole century. Another striking change in Málaga Bay is the disappearance of the cold Western Intermediate Water (WIW) after 1992. This could be the responsible of temperature changes in the Málaga continental shelf."
