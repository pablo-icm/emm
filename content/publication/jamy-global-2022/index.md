abstract: Abstract The successful colonization of new habitats has played a fundamental
  role during the evolution of life. Salinity is one of the strongest barriers for
  organisms to cross, which has resulted in the evolution of distinct marine and non-marine
  (including both freshwater and soil) communities. Although microbes represent by
  far the vast majority of eukaryote diversity, the role of the salt barrier in shaping
  the diversity across the eukaryotic tree is poorly known. Traditional views suggest
  rare and ancient marine/non-marine transitions but this view is being challenged
  by the discovery of several recently transitioned lineages. Here, we investigate
  habitat evolution across the tree of eukaryotes using a unique set of taxon-rich
  phylogenies inferred from a combination of long-read and short-read environmental
  metabarcoding data spanning the ribosomal DNA operon. Our results show that, overall,
  marine and non-marine microbial communities are phylogenetically distinct but transitions
  have occurred in both directions in almost all major eukaryotic lineages, with hundreds
  of transition events detected. Some groups have experienced relatively high rates
  of transitions, most notably fungi for which crossing the salt barrier has probably
  been an important aspect of their successful diversification. At the deepest phylogenetic
  levels, ancestral habitat reconstruction analyses suggest that eukaryotes may have
  first evolved in non-marine habitats and that the two largest known eukaryotic assemblages
  (TSAR and Amorphea) arose in different habitats. Overall, our findings indicate
  that the salt barrier has played an important role during eukaryote evolution and
  provide a global perspective on habitat transitions in this domain of life.
