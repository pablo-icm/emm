abstract: Abstract Protists (unicellular eukaryotes) arguably account for most eukaryotic
  diversity and are central players of the biosphere. Known protist diversity and
  biology is largely based on cultured strains. Yet, environmental molecular surveys
  have unveiled entirely novel lineages that, as their prokaryotic counterparts, are
  essentially uncultured. Culture bias is an important drawback for any microbe-related
  science and is particularly severe for heterotrophic protists, which depend on organic
  food sources for growth. Here, we show how ecologically significant bacterivorous
  protists have been brought into culture by mimicking in situ conditions. Single
  cells sorted by serial dilution or flow cytometry were inoculated into seawater
  amended with natural bacterial assemblage at nearly in situ abundances. Strains
  belonging to lineages only known so far from environmental sequencing were isolated.
  Among them, Minorisa minuta gen. nov. sp. nov. forms a novel branch within Rhizaria,
  holding a key evolutionary position, and with an average size of 1.4 μm represents
  one of the smallest bacterial grazers known to date. It has a worldwide planktonic
  distribution and can account for 5% of heterotrophic protists communities in coastal
  waters. Physiological features of this strain can partly explain its success in
  the environment. Culturing ecologically relevant but elusive protists provide invaluable
  material for ecophysiology, genomics, ecosystem modeling and evolutionary issues.
