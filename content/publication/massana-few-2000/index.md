abstract: ABSTRACT We compared the phylogenetic compositions of marine planktonic
  archaeal populations in different marine provinces. Samples from eight different
  environments were collected at two depths (surface and aphotic zone), and 16 genetic
  libraries of PCR-amplified archaeal 16S rRNA genes were constructed. The libraries
  were analyzed by using a three-step hierarchical approach. Membrane hybridization
  experiments revealed that most of the archaeal clones were affiliated with one of
  the two groups of marine archaea described previously, crenarchaeotal group I and
  euryarchaeotal group II. One of the 2,328 ribosomal DNA clones analyzed was related
  to a different euryarchaeal lineage, which was recently recovered from deep-water
  marine plankton. In temperate regions (Pacific Ocean, Atlantic Ocean, and Mediterranean
  Sea) both major groups were found at the two depths investigated; group II predominated
  at the surface, and group I predominated at depth. In Antarctic and subantarctic
  waters group II was practically absent. The clonal compositions of archaeal libraries
  were investigated by performing a restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP)
  analysis with two tetrameric restriction enzymes, which defined discrete operational
  taxonomic units (OTUs). The OTUs defined in this way were phylogenetically consistent;
  clones belonging to the same OTU were closely related. The clonal diversity as determined
  by the RFLP analysis was low, and most libraries were dominated by only one or two
  OTUs. Some OTUs were found in samples obtained from very distant places, indicating
  that some phylotypes were ubiquitous. A tree containing one example of each OTU
  detected was constructed, and this tree revealed that there were several clusters
  within archaeal group I and group II. The members of some of these clusters had
  different depth distributions.
