abstract: Abstract The heterotrophic bacterial community of the Eastern Mediterranean
  Sea is believed to be limited by phosphorus (P) availability. This observation assumes
  that all bacterial groups are equally limited, something that has not been hitherto
  examined. To test this hypothesis, we performed nutrient addition experiments and
  investigated the response of probe-identified groups using microautoradiography
  combined with catalyzed reporter deposition fluorescence in situ hybridization.
  Our results show contrasting responses between the bacterial groups, with Gammaproteobacteria
  being the group more affected by P availability. The Roseobacter clade was likely
  colimited by P and nitrogen (N), whereas Bacteroidetes by P, N and organic carbon
  (C). In contrast, SAR11 cells were active regardless of the nutrient concentration.
  These results indicate that there is high heterogeneity in the nutrient limitation
  of the different components of the bacterioplankton community.
