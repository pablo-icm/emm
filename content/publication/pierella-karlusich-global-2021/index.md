abstract: Abstract Nitrogen fixation has a critical role in marine primary production,
  yet our understanding of marine nitrogen-fixers (diazotrophs) is hindered by limited
  observations. Here, we report a quantitative image analysis pipeline combined with
  mapping of molecular markers for mining textgreater2,000,000 images and textgreater1300
  metagenomes from surface, deep chlorophyll maximum and mesopelagic seawater samples
  across 6 size fractions (textless0.2–2000 μm). We use this approach to characterise
  the diversity, abundance, biovolume and distribution of symbiotic, colony-forming
  and particle-associated diazotrophs at a global scale. We show that imaging and
  PCR-free molecular data are congruent. Sequence reads indicate diazotrophs are detected
  from the ultrasmall bacterioplankton (textless0.2 μm) to mesoplankton (180–2000 μm)
  communities, while images predict numerous symbiotic and colony-forming diazotrophs
  (textgreater20 µm). Using imaging and molecular data, we estimate that polyploidy
  can substantially affect gene abundances of symbiotic versus colony-forming diazotrophs.
  Our results support the canonical view that larger diazotrophs (textgreater10 μm)
  dominate the tropical belts, while unicellular cyanobacterial and non-cyanobacterial
  diazotrophs are globally distributed in surface and mesopelagic layers. We describe
  co-occurring diazotrophic lineages of different lifestyles and identify high-density
  regions of diazotrophs in the global ocean. Overall, we provide an update of marine
  diazotroph biogeographical diversity and present a new bioimaging-bioinformatic
  workflow.
