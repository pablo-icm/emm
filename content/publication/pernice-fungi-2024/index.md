abstract: Abstract  A plant parasite associated with the white haze disease in apples,
  the Basidiomycota Gjaerumia minor, has been found in most samples of the global
  bathypelagic ocean. An analysis of environmental 18S rDNA sequences on 12 vertical
  profiles of the Malaspina 2010 expedition shows that the relative abundance of this
  cultured species increases with depth while its distribution is remarkably different
  between the deep waters of the Pacific and Atlantic oceans, being present in higher
  concentrations in the former. This is evident from sequence analysis and a microscopic
  survey with a species-specific newly designed TSA-FISH probe. Several hints point
  to the hypothesis that G. minor is transported to the deep ocean attached to particles,
  and the absence of G. minor in bathypelagic Atlantic waters could then be explained
  by the absence of this organism in surface waters of the equatorial Atlantic. The
  good correlation of G. minor biomass with Apparent Oxygen Utilization, recalcitrant
  carbon and free-living prokaryotic biomass in South Pacific waters, together with
  the identification of the observed cells as yeasts and not as resting spores (teliospores),
  point to the possibility that once arrived at deep layers this species keeps on
  growing and thriving.
