A plant parasite associated with the white haze disease in apples, the Basidiomycota
Gjaerumia minor,
has been found in most samples of the global bathypelagic ocean. An analysis of environmental 18S rDNA sequences on 12 vertical profiles of the Malaspina 2010 expedition shows that the relative abundance of this cultured species increases with depth while its distribution is remarkably different between the deep waters of the Pacific and Atlantic oceans, being present in higher concentrations in the former. This is evident from sequence analysis and a microscopic survey with a species-specific newly designed TSA-FISH probe. Several hints point to the hypothesis that
G. minor
is transported to the deep ocean attached to particles, and the absence of
G. minor
in bathypelagic Atlantic waters could then be explained by the absence of this organism in surface waters of the equatorial Atlantic. The good correlation of
G. minor
biomass with Apparent Oxygen Utilization, recalcitrant carbon and free-living prokaryotic biomass in South Pacific waters, together with the identification of the observed cells as yeasts and not as resting spores (teliospores), point to the possibility that once arrived at deep layers this species keeps on growing and thriving.},
