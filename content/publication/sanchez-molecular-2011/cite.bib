 abstract = {Summary

The prokaryotic community composition of activated sludge from a seawater‐processing wastewater treatment plant (Almeria, Spain) was investigated by using the rRNA approach, combining different molecular techniques such as denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), clone libraries and
in situ
hybridization (FISH and CARD‐FISH). Most of the sequences retrieved in the DGGE and the clone libraries were similar to uncultured members of different phyla. The most abundant sequence recovered from Bacteria in the clone library corresponded to a bacterium from the
Deinococcus–Thermus
cluster (almost 77% of the clones), and the library included members from other groups such as the
Alpha, Gamma
and
Delta
subclasses of
Proteobacteria
, the
Bacteroidetes
and
Firmicutes
. Concerning the archaeal clone library, we basically found sequences related to different orders of methanogenic
Archaea
, in correspondence with the recovered DGGE bands. Enumeration of DAPI (4′,6‐diamidino‐2‐phenylindole) stained cells from two different activated sludge samples after a mechanical flocculation disruption revealed a mean cell count of 1.6 × 10
9
ml
−1
. Around 94% of DAPI counts (mean value from both samples) hybridized with a
Bacteria
specific probe.
Alphaproteobacteria
were the dominant bacterial group (36% of DAPI counts), while
Beta
‐,
Delta
‐ and
Gammaproteobacteria
,
Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria
and
Firmicutes
contributed to lower proportions (between 0.5–5.7% of DAPI counts).
Archaea
accounted only for 6% of DAPI counts. In addition, specific primers for amplification of the
amoA
(ammonia monooxygenase) gene were used to detect the presence of
Beta
,
Gamma
and archaeal nitrifiers, yielding positive amplifications only for
Betaproteobacteria
. This, together with negative
in situ
hybridizations with probes for well‐known nitrifiying bacteria, suggests that nitrification is performed by still undetected microorganisms. In summary, the combination of the three approaches provided different and complementary pictures of the real assemblage composition and allowed to get closer to the main microorganisms involved in key processes of seawater‐processing activated sludge.},
