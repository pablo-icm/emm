abstract: ABSTRACT  The kingdom Crenarchaeota is now known to include archaea which
  inhabit a wide variety of low-temperature environments. We report here lipid analyses
  of nonthermophilic crenarchaeotes, which revealed the presence of cyclic and acyclic
  dibiphytanylglycerol tetraether lipids. Nonthermophilic crenarchaeotes appear to
  be a major biological source of tetraether lipids in marine planktonic environments.
