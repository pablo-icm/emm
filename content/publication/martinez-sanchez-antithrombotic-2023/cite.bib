 abstract = {We evaluated modifications in the hemostatic balance of different concentrations of apixaban (APIX) in 25 healthy donors and 53 patients treated with aspirin (ASA, n = 21), ASA and clopidogrel (ASA + CLOPI, n = 11), or ASA and ticagrelor (ASA + TICA, n = 21). Blood samples from participants were spiked ex vivo with apixaban 0 (APIX0), 40 (APIX40), and 160&nbsp;ng/mL (APIX160). We assessed the effects of APIX on (1) clot formation, by ROTEM thromboelastometry; (2) thrombin generation primed by platelets; and (3) platelet and fibrin interactions with a thrombogenic surface, in a microfluidic model with circulating blood. APIX caused dose-related prolongations of clotting time with minimal impact on other ROTEM parameters. Thrombin generation was significantly inhibited by APIX160, with ASA + TICA actions showing the strongest inhibition (p &lt; 0.01 vs APIX0). Microfluidic studies showed that APIX160 was more potent at suppressing platelet and fibrin interactions (p &lt; 0.001 vs. APIX0). APIX40 demonstrated a consistent antithrombotic action but with a favorable protective effect on the structural quality of fibrin. APIX potentiated the antithrombotic effects of current antiplatelet regimens. APIX at 40&nbsp;ng/mL, enhanced the antithrombotic action of single or dual antiplatelet regimens but was more conservative for hemostasis than the 160&nbsp;ng/mL concentration.},
