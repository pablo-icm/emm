abstract: We evaluated modifications in the hemostatic balance of different concentrations
  of apixaban (APIX) in 25 healthy donors and 53 patients treated with aspirin (ASA,
  n = 21), ASA and clopidogrel (ASA + CLOPI, n = 11), or ASA and ticagrelor (ASA + TICA,
  n = 21). Blood samples from participants were spiked ex vivo with apixaban 0 (APIX0),
  40 (APIX40), and 160&nbsp;ng/mL (APIX160). We assessed the effects of APIX on (1)
  clot formation, by ROTEM thromboelastometry; (2) thrombin generation primed by platelets;
  and (3) platelet and fibrin interactions with a thrombogenic surface, in a microfluidic
  model with circulating blood. APIX caused dose-related prolongations of clotting
  time with minimal impact on other ROTEM parameters. Thrombin generation was significantly
  inhibited by APIX160, with ASA + TICA actions showing the strongest inhibition (p &lt; 0.01
  vs APIX0). Microfluidic studies showed that APIX160 was more potent at suppressing
  platelet and fibrin interactions (p &lt; 0.001 vs. APIX0). APIX40 demonstrated a
  consistent antithrombotic action but with a favorable protective effect on the structural
  quality of fibrin. APIX potentiated the antithrombotic effects of current antiplatelet
  regimens. APIX at 40&nbsp;ng/mL, enhanced the antithrombotic action of single or
  dual antiplatelet regimens but was more conservative for hemostasis than the 160&nbsp;ng/mL
  concentration.
