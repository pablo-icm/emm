abstract: Abstract Diatoms constitute a diverse lineage of unicellular organisms abundant
  and ecologically important in aquatic ecosystems. Compared to other protists, their
  biology and taxonomy are well-studied, offering the opportunity to combine traditional
  approaches and new technologies. We examined a dataset of diatom 18S rRNA- and rDNA-
  (V4 region) reads from different plankton size-fractions and sediments from six
  European coastal marine sites, with the aim of identifying peculiarities and commonalities
  with respect to the whole protistan community. Almost all metabarcodes (99.6%) were
  assigned to known genera (121) and species (236), the most abundant of which were
  those already known from classic studies and coincided with those seen in light
  microscopy. rDNA and rRNA showed comparable patterns for the dominant taxa, but
  rRNA revealed a much higher diversity particularly in the sediment communities.
  Peculiar to diatoms is a tight bentho-pelagic coupling, with many benthic or planktonic
  species colonizing both water column and sediments and the dominance of planktonic
  species in both habitats. Overall metabarcoding results reflected the marked specificity
  of diatoms compared to other protistan groups in terms of morphological and ecological
  characteristics, at the same time confirming their great potential in the description
  of protist communities.
