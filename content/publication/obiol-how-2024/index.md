abstract: Abstract Marine Stramenopiles (MAST) were first described two decades ago
  through ribosomal RNA gene (rRNA gene) sequences from marine surveys of microbial
  eukaryotes. MAST comprise several independent lineages at the base of the Stramenopiles.
  Despite their prevalence in the ocean, the majority of MAST diversity remains uncultured.
  Previous studies, mainly in marine environments, have explored MAST's cell morphology,
  distribution, trophic strategies, and genomics using culturing-independent methods.
  In comparison, less is known about their presence outside marine habitats. Here,
  we analyze the extensive EukBank dataset to assess the extent to which MAST can
  be considered marine protists. Additionally, by incorporating newly available rRNA
  gene sequences, we update Stramenopiles phylogeny, identifying three novel MAST
  lineages. Our results indicate that MAST are primarily marine with notable exceptions
  within MAST-2 and MAST-12, where certain subclades are prevalent in freshwater and
  soil habitats. In the marine water column, only a few MAST species, particularly
  within clades -1, -3, -4 and -7, dominate and exhibit clear latitudinal distribution
  patterns. Overall, the massive sequencing dataset analyzed in our study confirms
  and partially expands the previously described diversity of MASTs groups and underscores
  the predominantly marine nature of most of these uncultured lineages.
