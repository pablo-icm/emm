abstract: A series of dialysis experiments was performed to study the relative importance
  of substrate limitation and grazing in controlling the proportion of active cells
  of coastal marine bacterioplankton. The grazer community was manipulated by filling
  dialysis bags with unfiltered water and water serially passed through 150‐, 40‐,
  and 0.8‐ µ m pore‐size filters. The total number of bacteria, the number of metabolically
  active cells, bacterial loss rates, and the abundances of heterotrophic nanoflagellates
  were measured immediately and at 3 and 6 d. Gross growth rates were similar in all
  treatments, suggesting that ambient nutrient concentrations set an upper limit to
  the maximum growth rates, whereas grazing determined the net growth rates and the
  final number of bacteria. Bacterial loss rates, measured as the disappearance of
  fluorescently labeled minicells, correlated well with the initial density of heterotrophic
  nanoflagellates in the different treatments. The number of active cells at the end
  of the experiments varied widely among treatments and reached 2.0 × 10 6 ml ‒1 ,
  or over 55% of the total final density in dialysis bags, with little or no grazing
  by nanoflagellates. The final proportion of active cells was negatively correlated
  to both the loss rates and the initial nanoflagellate density, and it was estimated
  that grazing rates on metabolically active bacteria were four or more times higher
  than those on inactive bacteria. Heterotrophic nanoflagellates thus seemed to control
  bacterial density by skimming newly growing cells rather than by cropping the standing
  stock of bacteria.
