abstract: Summary  The main role of microorganisms in the cycling of the bulk dissolved
  organic carbon pool in the ocean is well established. Nevertheless, it remains unclear
  if particular bacteria preferentially utilize specific carbon compounds and whether
  such compounds have the potential to shape bacterial community composition. Enrichment
  experiments in the Mediterranean Sea, Baltic Sea and the North Sea (Skagerrak) showed
  that different low‐molecular‐weight organic compounds, with a proven importance
  for the growth of marine bacteria (e.g. amino acids, glucose, dimethylsulphoniopropionate,
  acetate or pyruvate), in most cases differentially stimulated bacterial growth.
  Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis ‘fingerprints’ and 16S rRNA gene sequencing
  revealed that some bacterial phylotypes that became abundant were highly specific
  to enrichment with specific carbon compounds (e.g. Acinetobacter sp. B1‐A3 with
  acetate or Psychromonas sp. B3‐U1 with glucose). In contrast, other phylotypes increased
  in relative abundance in response to enrichment with several, or all, of the investigated
  carbon compounds (e.g. Neptuniibacter sp. M2‐A4 with acetate, pyruvate and dimethylsulphoniopropionate,
  and Thalassobacter sp. M3‐A3 with pyruvate and amino acids). Furthermore, different
  carbon compounds triggered the development of unique combinations of dominant phylotypes
  in several of the experiments. These results suggest that bacteria differ substantially
  in their abilities to utilize specific carbon compounds, with some bacteria being
  specialists and others having a more generalist strategy. Thus, changes in the supply
  or composition of the dissolved organic carbon pool can act as selective forces
  structuring bacterioplankton communities.
