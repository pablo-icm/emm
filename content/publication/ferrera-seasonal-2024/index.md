abstract: Abstract Marine microbial communities differ genetically, metabolically,
  and ecologically according to their lifestyle, and they may respond differently
  to environmental changes. In this study, we investigated the seasonal dynamics of
  bacterial assemblies in the free‐living (FL) and particle‐associated (PA) fractions
  across a span of 6 years in the Blanes Bay Microbial Observatory in the Northwestern
  Mediterranean. Both lifestyles showed marked seasonality. The trends in alpha diversity
  were similar, with lower values in spring–summer than in autumn‐winter. Samples
  from both fractions were grouped seasonally and the percentage of community variability
  explained by the measured environmental variables was comparable (32% in FL and
  31% in PA). Canonical analyses showed that biotic interactions were determinants
  of bacterioplankton dynamics and that their relevance varies depending on lifestyles.
  Time‐decay curves confirmed a high degree of predictability in both fractions. Yet,
  ‘seasonal’ Amplicon Sequence Variants (ASVs) (as defined by Lomb Scargle time series
  analysis) in the PA communities represented 46% of the total relative abundance
  while these accounted for 30% in the FL fraction. These results demonstrate that
  bacteria inhabiting both fractions exhibit marked seasonality, highlighting the
  importance of accounting for both lifestyles to fully comprehend the dynamics of
  marine prokaryotic communities.
