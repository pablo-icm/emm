Aim

The need to go beyond taxonomy to understand patterns in microbial function has led to an increased use of trait‐based approaches, yet we know little about how microbial functional traits vary across large‐scale environmental gradients in natural ecosystems. Here, we apply a trait‐based approach to explore the large‐scale variability in the trait structure underlying the processing of dissolved organic matter (
DOM
) by boreal bacterioplankton communities, as well as its regulation and links to taxonomic composition.



Location

Samples were collected from 296 rivers and lakes across five regions in northern
Q
uebec (
C
anada), which span large gradients in environmental, climatic and geographical properties typical of the boreal zone.



Methods

We used the metabolic profiles obtained with
B
iolog
E
co
P
lates® as an imprint of the trait structure underlying bacterial processing of
DOM
, and
I
llumina sequencing of the
16SrRNA
gene to characterize the taxonomic composition of these bacterial assemblages. The resulting spatial patterns were compared with an array of climatic, landscape and limnological properties varying at the landscape scale.



Results

Despite a clear regional segregation of the sampled sites based on environmental variables, the trait structure of boreal bacteria did not show any regional or ecosystem‐specific patterns, but rather was linked to a gradient of quality of
DOM
. Community trait configurations diverged progressively with decreasing terrestrial influence, probably due to local processes that transform and diversify the available pool of
DOM
. This
DOM
quality gradient did not explain the taxonomic biogeography of these communities, which was controlled by a different set of environmental factors.



Main conclusions

The functional biogeography of boreal bacterioplankton is driven by the nature of the
DOM
pool, and particularly by the influence of terrestrial
DOM
. The lack of coherence between functional and taxonomic biogeographies implies that the environmental controls of freshwater bacterial performance cannot be directly inferred from spatial patterns in taxonomic composition."
