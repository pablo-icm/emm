abstract: Abstract Pico-sized eukaryotes play key roles in the functioning of marine
  ecosystems, but we still have a limited knowledge on their ecology and evolution.
  The MAST-4 lineage is of particular interest, since it is widespread in surface
  oceans, presents ecotypic differentiation and has defied culturing efforts so far.
  Single cell genomics (SCG) are promising tools to retrieve genomic information from
  these uncultured organisms. However, SCG are based on whole genome amplification,
  which normally introduces amplification biases that limit the amount of genomic
  data retrieved from a single cell. Here, we increase the recovery of genomic information
  from two MAST-4 lineages by co-assembling short reads from multiple Single Amplified
  Genomes (SAGs) belonging to evolutionary closely related cells. We found that complementary
  genomic information is retrieved from different SAGs, generating co-assembly that
  features textgreater74% of genome recovery, against about 20% when assembled individually.
  Even though this approach is not aimed at generating high-quality draft genomes,
  it allows accessing to the genomic information of microbes that would otherwise
  remain unreachable. Since most of the picoeukaryotes still remain uncultured, our
  work serves as a proof-of-concept that can be applied to other taxa in order to
  extract genomic data and address new ecological and evolutionary questions.
