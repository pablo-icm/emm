abstract: "Starting from Agnès Varda’s film The Gleaners and I (2000), we explore the concept of gleaning by proposing an art-science collaboration rooted in data ecology. The interactions are based on recovering data, materials, and experiences generated by scientific practice but discarded for scientific use, in order to promote cycles of reallocation of value and meaning through artistic practice. The article describes the meeting process and the development of a collaborative methodology between scientists from the Institut de Ciències del Mar (ICM-CSIC) and artists and researchers from the Centre Universitari d’Arts i Disseny de Barcelona (BAU). It presents tools, dynamics, and working processes for interpreting and integrating data ecology into both scientific and artistic research, fostering a more sustainable and hospitable relationship between art and science."
