abstract: Abstract  The free‐living ( FL ) and particle‐attached ( PA ) marine microbial
  communities have repeatedly been proved to differ in their diversity and composition
  in the photic ocean and also recently in the bathypelagic ocean at a global scale.
  However, although high taxonomic ranks exhibit preferences for a PA or FL mode of
  life, it remains poorly understood whether two clear lifestyles do exist and how
  these are distributed across the prokaryotic phylogeny. We studied the FL (textless0.8 μm)
  and PA (0.8–20 μm) prokaryotes at 30 stations distributed worldwide within the bathypelagic
  oceanic realm (2150–4000 m depth) using high‐throughput sequencing of the small
  subunit ribosomal RNA gene (16S rRNA ). A high proportion of the bathypelagic prokaryotes
  were mostly found either attached to particles or freely in the surrounding water
  but rarely in both types of environments. In particular, this trait was deeply conserved
  through their phylogeny, suggesting that the deep‐ocean particles and the surrounding
  water constitute two highly distinct niches and that transitions from one to the
  other have been rare at an evolutionary timescale. As a consequence, PA and FL communities
  had clear alpha‐ and beta‐diversity differences that exceeded the global‐scale geographical
  variation. Our study organizes the bathypelagic prokaryotic diversity into a reasonable
  number of ecologically coherent taxa regarding their association with particles,
  a first step for understanding which are the microbes responsible for the processing
  of the dissolved and particulate pools of organic matter that have a very different
  biogeochemical role in the deep ocean.
