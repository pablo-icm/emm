abstract: ABSTRACT  Growth is one of the basic attributes of any living organism.
  Surprisingly, the growth rates of marine bacterioplankton are only poorly known.
  Current data suggest that marine bacteria grow relatively slowly, having generation
  times of several days. However, some bacterial groups, such as the aerobic anoxygenic
  phototrophic (AAP) bacteria, have been shown to grow much faster. Two manipulation
  experiments, in which grazing, viruses, and resource competition were reduced, were
  conducted in the coastal Mediterranean Sea (Blanes Bay Microbial Observatory). The
  growth rates of AAP bacteria and of several important phylogenetic groups (the Bacteroidetes
  , the alphaproteobacterial groups Roseobacter and SAR11, and the Gammaproteobacteria
  group and its subgroups the Alteromonadaceae and the NOR5/OM60 clade) were calculated
  from changes in cell numbers in the manipulation treatments. In addition, we examined
  the role that top-down (mortality due to grazers and viruses) and bottom-up (resource
  availability) factors play in determining the growth rates of these groups. Manipulations
  resulted in an increase of the growth rates of all groups studied, but its extent
  differed largely among the individual treatments and among the different groups.
  Interestingly, higher growth rates were found for the AAP bacteria (up to 3.71 day
  −1 ) and for the Alteromonadaceae (up to 5.44 day −1 ), in spite of the fact that
  these bacterial groups represented only a very low percentage of the total prokaryotic
  community. In contrast, the SAR11 clade, which was the most abundant group, was
  the slower grower in all treatments. Our results show that, in general, the least
  abundant groups exhibited the highest rates, whereas the most abundant groups were
  those growing more slowly, indicating that some minor groups, such the AAP bacteria,
  very likely contribute much more to the recycling of organic matter in the ocean
  than what their abundances alone would predict.
