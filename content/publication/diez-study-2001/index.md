abstract: ABSTRACT  Very small eukaryotic organisms (picoeukaryotes) are fundamental
  components of marine planktonic systems, often accounting for a significant fraction
  of the biomass and activity in a system. Their identity, however, has remained elusive,
  since the small cells lack morphological features for identification. We determined
  the diversity of marine picoeukaryotes by sequencing cloned 18S rRNA genes in five
  genetic libraries from North Atlantic, Southern Ocean, and Mediterranean Sea surface
  waters. Picoplankton were obtained by filter size fractionation, a step that excluded
  most large eukaryotes and recovered most picoeukaryotes. Genetic libraries of eukaryotic
  ribosomal DNA were screened by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis,
  and at least one clone of each operational taxonomic unit (OTU) was partially sequenced.
  In general, the phylogenetic diversity in each library was rather great, and each
  library included many different OTUs and members of very distantly related phylogenetic
  groups. Of 225 eukaryotic clones, 126 were affiliated with algal classes, especially
  the Prasinophyceae, the Prymnesiophyceae, the Bacillariophyceae, and the Dinophyceae.
  A minor fraction (27 clones) was affiliated with clearly heterotrophic organisms,
  such as ciliates, the chrysomonad Paraphysomonas , cercomonads, and fungi. There
  were two relatively abundant novel lineages, novel stramenopiles (53 clones) and
  novel alveolates (19 clones). These lineages are very different from any organism
  that has been isolated, suggesting that there are previously unknown picoeukaryotes.
  Prasinophytes and novel stramenopile clones were very abundant in all of the libraries
  analyzed. These findings underscore the importance of attempts to grow the small
  eukaryotic plankton in pure culture.
