abstract: Summary  Bacterial and archaeal assemblages have been studied in a multipond
  solar saltern using a range of microbial ecology techniques by four laboratories
  simultaneously. These include 16S rDNA sequencing from both denaturing gradient
  gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and clone libraries, and culturing methods. Water samples
  from eight ponds were analysed, covering a salinity range from near sea water (4%
  salt) to saturated sodium chloride (37% salt; ponds called crystallizers). Clone
  libraries focused on ponds with salinity of 8%, 22% and 32%. Although different
  cloning strategies were able to retrieve the same type of dominant sequences, there
  were differing degrees of success with less abundant sequences. Thus, the use of
  two sets of primers recovered a higher number of phylotypes. Bacterial and archaeal
  isolates were, however, different from any of the retrieved environmental sequences.
  For Bacteria, most sequences in the 8% salt pond were related to organisms of marine
  origin. Thus, representatives of the alpha‐, beta‐, gamma‐ and epsilon‐subdivisions
  of Proteobacteria, the Cytophaga–Flavobacterium–Bacteroides group (CFB), high‐G+C
  Gram‐positive bacteria and cyanobacteria were found. In the 22% salt pond, alpha‐
  and gamma‐Proteobacteria, cyanobacteria and CFB were the only groups found, and
  most of them were related to specialized halophilic bacteria. From the 32% salt
  pond, only CFB were found, and most of the sequences retrieved clustered with Salinibacter
  ruber , an extremely halophilic bacterium. A decrease in the richness of bacterial
  genera was therefore apparent along the gradient. Archaea behaved quite similarly.
  In the lowest salinity ponds, sequences were related to environmental clones of
  Marine Archaea Group III ( Thermoplasmales relatives) and to unclassified branches
  of Euryarchaeaota. In the 8%, 22% and 32% ponds, most of the clones were related
  to different cultured strains of Halobacteriaceae. Finally, most sequences from
  the crystallizers clustered with the uncultured square archaeon SPhT. Crenarchaeaota
  were not detected. Despite the fact that higher prokaryotic richness was apparent
  in the lower salinity ponds than in the crystallizers, the diversity index from
  clone libraries calculated according to Shannon and Weaver did not show this trend.
  This was because diversity in the crystallizers can be considered as ‘microdiversity’,
  the co‐existence of several closely related clones of Bacteria (the S. ruber cluster)
  and Archaea (the SPhT cluster). Regardless of the changes in abundance, both Bacteria
  and Archaea showed the same pattern; as salinity increased, the number of different
  clusters decreased, and only one cluster became dominant. Both clusters, however,
  showed a considerable degree of microdiversity. The meaning of such microdiversity
  remains to be determined.
