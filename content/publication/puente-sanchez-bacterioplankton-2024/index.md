abstract: Microbial assemblages under the sea ice of the Dease Strait, Canadian Arctic,
  were sequenced for metagenomes of a small size fraction (0.2–3 μm). The community
  from early March was typical for this season, with Alpha- and Gammaproteobacteria
  as the dominant taxa, followed by Thaumarchaeota and Bacteroidetes. Toward summer,
  Bacteroidetes, and particularly the genus Polaribacter, became increasingly dominant,
  followed by the Gammaproteobacteria. Analysis of genes responsible for microbial
  acquisition of iron showed an abundance of ABC transporters for divalent cations
  and ferrous iron. The most abundant transporters, however, were the outer membrane
  TonB-dependent transporters of iron-siderophore complexes. The abundance of iron
  acquisition genes suggested this element was essential for the microbial assemblage.
  Interestingly, Gammaproteobacteria were responsible for most of the siderophore
  synthesis genes. On the contrary, Bacteroidetes did not synthesize siderophores
  but accounted for most of the transporters, suggesting a role as cheaters in the
  competition for siderophores as public goods. This cheating ability of the Bacteroidetes
  may have contributed to their dominance in the summer.
