abstract: Summary Proteorhodopsins, ubiquitous retinylidene photoactive proton pumps,
  were recently found in the widespread uncultured SAR86 bacterial group in oceanic
  surface waters. To survey proteorhodopsin diversity, new degenerate sets of proteorhodopsin
  primers were designed based on a genomic proteorhodopsin gene sequence originating
  from an Antarctic fosmid library. New proteorhodopsin variants were identified in
  Red Sea samples that were most similar to the original green-light absorbing proteorhodopsins
  found in Monterey Bay California. Unlike green-absorbing proteorhodopsins however,
  these new variants contained a glutamine residue at position 105, the same site
  recently shown to control spectral tuning in naturally occurring proteorhodopsins.
  Different proteorhodopsin variants were also found in the Mediterranean Sea. These
  proteorhodopsins formed new and distinctive proteorhodopsin groups. Phylogenetic
  analyses show that some of the new variants were very different from previously
  characterized proteorhodopsins, and formed the deepest branching groups found so
  far among marine proteorhodopsins. The existence of these varied proteorhodopsin
  sequences suggests that this class of proteins has undergone substantial evolution.
  These variants could represent functionally divergent paralogous genes, derived
  from the same or similar species, or orthologous proteorhodopsins that are distributed
  amongst divergent planktonic microbial taxa.
