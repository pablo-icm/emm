abstract: Abstract  Predicting responses of plankton to variations in essential nutrients
  is hampered by limited in situ measurements, a poor understanding of community composition,
  and the lack of reference gene catalogs for key taxa. Iron is a key driver of plankton
  dynamics and, therefore, of global biogeochemical cycles and climate. To assess
  the impact of iron availability on plankton communities, we explored the comprehensive
  bio‐oceanographic and bio‐omics data sets from Tara Oceans in the context of the
  iron products from two state‐of‐the‐art global scale biogeochemical models. We obtained
  novel information about adaptation and acclimation toward iron in a range of phytoplankton,
  including picocyanobacteria and diatoms, and identified whole subcommunities covarying
  with iron. Many of the observed global patterns were recapitulated in the Marquesas
  archipelago, where frequent plankton blooms are believed to be caused by natural
  iron fertilization, although they are not captured in large‐scale biogeochemical
  models. This work provides a proof of concept that integrative analyses, spanning
  from genes to ecosystems and viruses to zooplankton, can disentangle the complexity
  of plankton communities and can lead to more accurate formulations of resource bioavailability
  in biogeochemical models, thus improving our understanding of plankton resilience
  in a changing environment.  ,  Plain Language Summary  Marine phytoplankton require
  iron for their growth and proliferation. According to John Martin's iron hypothesis,
  fertilizing the ocean with iron could dramatically increase photosynthetic activity,
  thus representing a biological means to counteract global warming. However, while
  there is a constantly growing knowledge of how iron is distributed in the ocean
  and about its role in cellular processes in marine photosynthetic groups such as
  diatoms and cyanobacteria, less is known about how iron availability shapes plankton
  communities and how they respond to it. In the present work, we exploited recently
  published Tara Oceans data sets to address these questions. We first defined specific
  subcommunities of co‐occurring organisms that co‐vary with iron availability in
  the oceans. We then identified specific patterns of adaptation and acclimation to
  iron in different groups of phytoplankton. Finally, we validated our global results
  at local scale, specifically in the Marquesas archipelago, where recurrent phytoplankton
  blooms are believed to be a result of iron fertilization. By integrating global
  data with a localized response, we provide a framework for understanding the resilience
  of plankton ecosystems in a changing environment.  ,  Key Points    Coherent assemblages
  of taxa covarying with iron at global level are identified in plankton communities   Functional
  responses to iron availability involve both changes in copy numbers of iron‐responsive
  genes and their transcriptional regulation   Plankton responses to local variations
  in iron concentrations recapitulate global patterns
