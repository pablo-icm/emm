abstract: Abstract Microbes play key roles in the functioning of the biosphere. Still,
  our knowledge about their total diversity is very limited. In particular, we lack
  a clear understanding of the evolutionary dynamics occurring within their populations
  (i.e. among members of the same biological species). Unlike animals and plants,
  microbes normally have huge population sizes, high reproductive rates and the potential
  for unrestricted dispersal. As a consequence, the knowledge of population genetics
  acquired from studying animals and plants cannot be applied without extensive testing
  to microbes. Next generation molecular tools, like High Throughput Sequencing (e.g.
  454 and Illumina) coupled to Single Cell Genomics, now allow investigating microbial
  populations at a very fine scale. Such techniques have the potential to shed light
  on several ecological and evolutionary processes occurring within microbial populations
  that so far have remained hidden. Furthermore, they may facilitate the identification
  of microbial species. Eventually, we may find an answer to the question of whether
  microbes and multicellular organisms follow the same or different rules in their
  population diversification patterns.
