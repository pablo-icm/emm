abstract: Previous evidence has shown that benthic hydroids capture all kinds of available
  prey and the only known constraint was prey size. Among the prey captured are phytoplankton
  cells but it is not known whether they are digested and assimilated. To test the
  hypothesis that benthic hydroids assimilate phytoplankton cells, a series of feeding
  experiments was carried out with the Mediterranean species Eudendrium racemosum
  . Ingestion rates and assimilation efficiency were determined by analysing the 14
  C incorporated from a labelled population of the diatom species Thalassiosira weissflogii.
  Eudendrium racemosum fed on T. weissflogii , after a period of starvation, and with
  the diatoms as the sole food item. In the presence of approximately 15,000 diatoms
  ml −1 , Eudendrium fed at rates ranging from 16 to 55 diatoms polyp −1 hour −1 .
  Accumulation of radioactivity in the hydrocaulus and the polyps of the hydroids
  were observed. A maximum ingestion of 31.6 diatoms per μgC of polyp (i.e. 175 diatoms
  per polyp) was observed in the experiments. Most of the diatom 14 C ingested would
  have ended up in the Eudendrium tissue (efficiency 94%), and it was expected that
  a certain percentage would have been respired by the polyps. These data show that
  Eudendrium feed on phytoplankton, which can satisfy almost 100% of their energy
  demand when this type of food is sufficiently abundant.
