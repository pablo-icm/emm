 abstract = {Previous evidence has shown that benthic hydroids capture all kinds of available prey and the only known constraint was prey size. Among the prey captured are phytoplankton cells but it is not known whether they are digested and assimilated. To test the hypothesis that benthic hydroids assimilate phytoplankton cells, a series of feeding experiments was carried out with the Mediterranean species
Eudendrium racemosum
. Ingestion rates and assimilation efficiency were determined by analysing the
14
C incorporated from a labelled population of the diatom species
Thalassiosira weissflogii. Eudendrium racemosum
fed on
T. weissflogii
, after a period of starvation, and with the diatoms as the sole food item. In the presence of approximately 15,000 diatoms ml
−1
,
Eudendrium
fed at rates ranging from 16 to 55 diatoms polyp
−1
hour
−1
. Accumulation of radioactivity in the hydrocaulus and the polyps of the hydroids were observed. A maximum ingestion of 31.6 diatoms per μgC of polyp (i.e. 175 diatoms per polyp) was observed in the experiments. Most of the diatom
14
C ingested would have ended up in the
Eudendrium
tissue (efficiency 94%), and it was expected that a certain percentage would have been respired by the polyps. These data show that
Eudendrium
feed on phytoplankton, which can satisfy almost 100% of their energy demand when this type of food is sufficiently abundant.},
