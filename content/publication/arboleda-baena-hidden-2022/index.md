abstract: "In marine ecosystems, most invertebrates possess diverse microbiomes on their external surfaces, such as those found in the pedal mucus of grazing gastropods and chitons that aids displacement on different surfaces. The microbes are then transported around and placed in contact with free-living microbial communities of micro and other macro-organisms, potentially exchanging species and homogenizing microbial composition and structure among grazer hosts. Here, we characterize the microbiota of the pedal mucus of five distantly related mollusk grazers, quantify differences in microbial community structure, mucus protein and carbohydrate content, and, through a simple laboratory experiment, assess their effects on integrated measures of biofilm abundance. Over 665 Amplicon Sequence Variants (ASVs) were found across grazers, with significant differences in abundance and composition among grazer species and epilithic biofilms. The pulmonate limpet
Siphonaria lessonii
and the periwinkle
Echinolittorina peruviana
shared similar microbiota. The microbiota of the chiton
Chiton granosus,
keyhole limpet
Fissurella crassa,
and scurrinid limpet
Scurria araucana
differed markedly from one another, and form those of the pulmonate limpet and periwinkle. Flavobacteriaceae (Bacteroidia) and Colwelliaceae (Gammaproteobacteria) were the most common among microbial taxa. Microbial strict specialists were found in only one grazer species. The pedal mucus pH was similar among grazers, but carbohydrate and protein concentrations differed significantly. Yet, differences in mucus composition were not reflected in microbial community structure. Only the pedal mucus of
F. crassa
and
S. lessonii
negatively affected the abundance of photosynthetic microorganisms in the biofilm, demonstrating the specificity of the pedal mucus effects on biofilm communities. Thus, the pedal mucus microbiota are distinct among grazer hosts and can affect and interact non-trophically with the epilithic biofilms on which grazers feed, potentially leading to microbial community coalescence mediated by grazer movement. Further studies are needed to unravel the myriad of non-trophic interactions and their reciprocal impacts between macro- and microbial communities."
