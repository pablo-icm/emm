abstract: 'Summary  We used catalysed reported deposition – fluorescence in situ hybridization
  (CARD‐FISH) to analyse changes in the abundance of the bacterial groups Alphaproteobacteria
  , Gammaproteobacteria and Bacteroidetes, and of hydrocarbon‐degrading Cycloclasticus
  bacteria in mesocosms that had received polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)
  additions. The effects of PAHs were assessed under four contrasting hydrographic
  conditions in the coastal upwelling system of the Rías Baixas: winter mixing, spring
  bloom, summer stratification and autumn upwelling. We used realistic additions of
  water soluble PAHs (approximately 20–30 μg l −1 equivalent of chrysene), but during
  the winter period we also investigated the effect of higher PAHs concentrations
  (10–80 μg l −1 chrysene) on the bacterial community using microcosms. The most significant
  change observed was a significant reduction (68 ± 5%) in the relative abundance
  of Alphaproteobacteria . The magnitude of the response of Cycloclasticus bacteria
  (positive with probe CYPU829) to PAHs additions varied depending on the initial
  environmental conditions, and on the initial concentration of added PAHs. Our results
  clearly show that bacteria of the C ycloclasticus group play a major role in low
  molecular weight PAHs biodegradation in this planktonic ecosystem. Their response
  was stronger in colder waters, when their background abundance was also higher.
  During the warm periods, the response of Cycloclasticus was limited, possibly due
  to both, a lower bioavailability of PAHs caused by abiotic factors (solar radiation,
  temperature), and by inorganic nutrient limitation of bacterial growth.'
