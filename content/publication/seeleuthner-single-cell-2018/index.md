abstract: Abstract  Single-celled eukaryotes (protists) are critical players in global
  biogeochemical cycling of nutrients and energy in the oceans. While their roles
  as primary producers and grazers are well appreciated, other aspects of their life
  histories remain obscure due to challenges in culturing and sequencing their natural
  diversity. Here, we exploit single-cell genomics and metagenomics data from the
  circumglobal Tara Oceans expedition to analyze the genome content and apparent oceanic
  distribution of seven prevalent lineages of uncultured heterotrophic stramenopiles.
  Based on the available data, each sequenced genome or genotype appears to have a
  specific oceanic distribution, principally correlated with water temperature and
  depth. The genome content provides hypotheses for specialization in terms of cell
  motility, food spectra, and trophic stages, including the potential impact on their
  lifestyles of horizontal gene transfer from prokaryotes. Our results support the
  idea that prominent heterotrophic marine protists perform diverse functions in ocean
  ecology.
