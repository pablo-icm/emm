abstract: "Summary

The opisthokonts are one of the major super groups of eukaryotes. It comprises two major clades: (i) the
M
etazoa and their unicellular relatives and (ii) the
F
ungi and their unicellular relatives. There is, however, little knowledge of the role of opisthokont microbes in many natural environments, especially among non‐metazoan and non‐fungal opisthokonts. Here, we begin to address this gap by analysing high‐throughput 18
S rDNA
and 18
S rRNA
sequencing data from different European coastal sites, sampled at different size fractions and depths. In particular, we analyse the diversity and abundance of choanoflagellates, filastereans, ichthyosporeans, nucleariids, corallochytreans and their related lineages. Our results show the great diversity of choanoflagellates in coastal waters as well as a relevant representation of the ichthyosporeans and the uncultured marine opisthokonts (
MAOP
). Furthermore, we describe a new lineage of marine fonticulids (
MAFO
) that appears to be abundant in sediments. Taken together, our work points to a greater potential ecological role for unicellular opisthokonts than previously appreciated in marine environments, both in water column and sediments, and also provides evidence of novel opisthokont phylogenetic lineages. This study highlights the importance of high‐throughput sequencing approaches to unravel the diversity and distribution of both known and novel eukaryotic lineages."
