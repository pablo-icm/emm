abstract: Abstract  Understanding the patterns of marine microbial diversity (Bacteria + Archaea)
  is essential, as variations in their alpha‐ and beta‐diversities can affect ecological
  processes. Investigations of microbial diversity from global oceanographic expeditions
  and basin‐wide transects show positive correlations between microbial diversity
  and either temperature or productivity, but these studies rarely captured seasonality,
  especially in polar regions. Here, using multiannual alpha‐diversity data from eight
  time series in the northern and southern hemispheres, we show that marine microbial
  community richness and evenness generally correlate more strongly with daylength
  than with temperature or chlorophyll a (a proxy for photosynthetic biomass). This
  pattern is observable across time series found in the northern and southern hemispheres
  regardless of collection method, DNA extraction protocols, targeted 16S rRNA hypervariable
  region, sequencing technology, or bioinformatics pipeline.
