abstract: 'Summary  Here we investigated whether there is evidence of local adaptation
  in strains of an ancestrally marine dinoflagellate to the lacustrine environment
  they now inhabit (optimal genotypes) and/or if they have evolved phenotypic plasticity
  (a range of phenotypes). Eleven strains of  P  olarella glacialis were isolated
  and cultured from three different environments: the polar seas, a hyposaline and
  a hypersaline Antarctic lake. Local adaptation was tested by comparing growth rates
  of lacustrine and marine strains at their own and reciprocal site conditions. To
  determine phenotypic plasticity, we measured the reaction norm for salinity. We
  found evidence of both, limited local adaptation and higher phenotypic plasticity
  in lacustrine strains when compared with marine ancestors. At extreme high salinities,
  local lake strains outperformed other strains, and at extreme low salinities, strains
  from the hyposaline lake outperformed all other strains. The data suggest that lake
  populations may have evolved higher phenotypic plasticity in the lake habitats compared
  with the sea, presumably due to the high temporal variability in salinity in the
  lacustrine systems. Moreover, the interval of salinity tolerance differed between
  strains from the hyposaline and hypersaline lakes, indicating local adaptation promoted
  by different salinity.'
