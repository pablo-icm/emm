abstract: Recent molecular investigations of marine samples taken from different environments,
  including tropical, temperate and polar areas, as well as deep thermal vents, have
  revealed an unexpectedly high diversity of protists, some of them forming deep-branching
  clades within important lineages, such as the alveolates and heterokonts. Using
  the same approach on coastal samples, we have identified a novel group of protist
  small subunit (SSU) rDNA sequences that do not correspond to any phylogenetic group
  previously identified. Comparison with other sequences obtained from cultures of
  heterotrophic protists showed that the environmental sequences grouped together
  with Telonema , a genus known since 1913 but of uncertain taxonomic affinity. Phylogenetic
  analyses using four genes (SSU, Hsp90 , alpha-tubulin and beta-tubulin ), and accounting
  for gamma- and covarion-distributed substitution rates, revealed Telonema as a distinct
  group of species branching off close to chromist lineages. Consistent with these
  gene trees, Telonema possesses ultrastructures revealing both the distinctness of
  the group and the evolutionary affinity to chromist groups. Altogether, the data
  suggest that Telonema constitutes a new eukaryotic phylum, here defined as Telonemia,
  possibly representing a key clade for the understanding of the early evolution of
  bikont protist groups, such as the proposed chromalveolate supergroup.
