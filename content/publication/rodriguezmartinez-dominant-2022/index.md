abstract: Summary  Grazing controls bacterial abundances and composition in many ecosystems.
  In marine systems, heterotrophic flagellates (HFs) are important predators. Assemblages
  of HFs are primarily formed by species still uncultured; therefore, many aspects
  of their trophic behaviour are poorly known. Here, we assessed the functional response
  of the whole assemblage and of four taxa grown in an unamended seawater incubation.
  We used fluorescently labelled bacteria to create a prey gradient of two orders
  of magnitude in abundance and estimated ingestion rates. Natural HFs had a half‐saturation
  constant of 6.7 × 10 5 prey ml −1 , a value lower than that of cultured flagellates
  and within the range of marine planktonic bacterial abundances. Minorisa minuta
  was well adapted to low prey abundances and very efficient in ingesting bacteria.
  MAST‐4 and MAST‐7 were also well adapted to the typical marine abundances but less
  voracious. In contrast, Paraphysomonas imperforata , a typical cultured species,
  did not achieve ingestion rate saturation even at the highest prey concentration
  assayed. Our study, beside to set the basis for the fundamental differences between
  cultured and uncultured bacterial grazers, indicate that the examined predator taxa
  have different functional responses, suggesting that they occupy distinct ecological
  niches according to their grazing strategies and prey preferences.
