Grazing controls bacterial abundances and composition in many ecosystems. In marine systems, heterotrophic flagellates (HFs) are important predators. Assemblages of HFs are primarily formed by species still uncultured; therefore, many aspects of their trophic behaviour are poorly known. Here, we assessed the functional response of the whole assemblage and of four taxa grown in an unamended seawater incubation. We used fluorescently labelled bacteria to create a prey gradient of two orders of magnitude in abundance and estimated ingestion rates. Natural HFs had a half‐saturation constant of 6.7 × 10

, a value lower than that of cultured flagellates and within the range of marine planktonic bacterial abundances.
Minorisa minuta
was well adapted to low prey abundances and very efficient in ingesting bacteria. MAST‐4 and MAST‐7 were also well adapted to the typical marine abundances but less voracious. In contrast,
Paraphysomonas imperforata
, a typical cultured species, did not achieve ingestion rate saturation even at the highest prey concentration assayed. Our study, beside to set the basis for the fundamental differences between cultured and uncultured bacterial grazers, indicate that the examined predator taxa have different functional responses, suggesting that they occupy distinct ecological niches according to their grazing strategies and prey preferences.},
