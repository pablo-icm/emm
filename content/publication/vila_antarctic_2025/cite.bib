    abstract = {The Earth’s poles have always aroused great interest, from early explorers seeking new passages to present-day scientists studying some of the most sensitive regions of the planet. Polar regions play a key role in regulating global climate and ocean circulation, yet they remain largely unknown to society. This article presents educational and outreach initiatives focused on Antarctic and Arctic science, aimed at bringing polar research into classrooms and closer to the general public. Through hands-on activities, exhibitions, and collaborative projects between scientists and educators, these initiatives foster ocean and polar literacy, encourage critical thinking about global change, and promote a deeper understanding of the relevance of polar science for society.},
