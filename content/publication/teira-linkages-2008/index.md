abstract: 'Summary  We used mesocosm experiments to study the bacterioplankton community
  in a highly dynamic coastal ecosystem during four contrasting periods of the seasonal
  cycle: winter mixing, spring phytoplankton bloom, summer stratification and autumn
  upwelling. A correlation approach was used in order to measure the degree of coupling
  between the dynamics of major bacterial groups, heterotrophic carbon cycling and
  environmental factors. We used catalysed reporter deposition‐fluorescence in situ
  hybridization to follow changes in the relative abundance of the most abundant groups
  of bacteria (Alphaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria and Bacteroidetes). Bacterial
  carbon flux‐related variables included bacterial standing stock, bacterial production
  and microbial respiration. The environmental factors included both, biotic variables
  such as chlorophyll‐a concentration, primary production, phytoplankton extracellular
  release, and abiotic variables such as the concentration of dissolved inorganic
  and organic nutrients. Rapid shifts in the dominant bacterial groups occurred associated
  to environmental changes and bacterial bulk functions. An alternation between Alphaproteobacteria
  and Bacteroidetes was observed associated to different phytoplankton growth phases.
  The dominance of the group Bacteroidetes was related to high bacterial biomass and
  production. We found a significant, non‐spurious, linkage between the relative abundances
  of major bacterial groups and bacterial carbon cycling. Our results suggest that
  bacteria belonging to these major groups could actually share a function in planktonic
  ecosystems.'
