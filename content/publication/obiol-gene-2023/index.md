abstract: Abstract  Background Marine heterotrophic flagellates (HF) are dominant
  bacterivores in the ocean, where they represent the trophic link between bacteria
  and higher trophic levels and participate in the recycling of inorganic nutrients
  for regenerated primary production. Studying their activity and function in the
  ecosystem is challenging since most of the HFs in the ocean are still uncultured.
  In the present work, we investigated gene expression of natural HF communities during
  bacterivory in four unamended seawater incubations.   Results The most abundant
  species growing in our incubations belonged to the taxonomic groups MAST-4, MAST-7,
  Chrysophyceae, and Telonemia. Gene expression dynamics were similar between incubations
  and could be divided into three states based on microbial counts, each state displaying
  distinct expression patterns. The analysis of samples where HF growth was highest
  revealed some highly expressed genes that could be related to bacterivory. Using
  available genomic and transcriptomic references, we identified 25 species growing
  in our incubations and used those to compare the expression levels of these specific
  genes.   Conclusions Our results indicate that several peptidases, together with
  some glycoside hydrolases and glycosyltransferases, are more expressed in phagotrophic
  than in phototrophic species, and thus could be used to infer the process of bacterivory
  in natural assemblages.
