abstract: ABSTRACT  We studied the effects of nutrient availability and protistan
  grazing on bacterial dynamics and community composition (BCC) in different parts
  of the canyon-shaped Římov reservoir (Czech Republic). The effects of protistan
  grazing on BCC were examined using a size fractionation approach. Water from the
  dam area with only bacteria (textless0.8 μm), bacteria and heterotrophic nanoflagellates
  (textless5 μm), or whole water were incubated in situ inside dialysis bags. Top-down
  or predator manipulations (size fractionation) were also combined with bottom-up
  or resource manipulations, i.e., transplantation of samples to the middle and upper
  inflow parts of the reservoir with increased phosphorus availability. Significant
  genotypic shifts in BCC occurred with transplantation as indicated by denaturing
  gradient gel electrophoresis. Using different probes for fluorescence in situ hybridization,
  we found that 10 to 50% of total bacteria were members of the phylogenetically small
  cluster of β-proteobacteria (targeted with the probe R-BT065). These rod-shaped
  cells of very uniform size were vulnerable to predation but very fast growing and
  responded markedly to the different experimental manipulations. In all the grazer-free
  treatments, the members of the R-BT065 cluster showed the highest net growth rates
  of all studied bacterial groups. Moreover, their relative abundance was highly correlated
  with bacterial bulk parameters and proportions of bacteria with high nucleic acid
  (HNA) content. In contrast, increasing protistan bacterivory yielded lower proportions
  of R-BT065-positive and HNA bacteria substituted by increasing proportions of the
  class Actinobacteria , which profited from the enhanced protistan bacterivory.
