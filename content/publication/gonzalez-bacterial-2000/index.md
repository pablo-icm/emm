abstract: ABSTRACT  The bacteria associated with oceanic algal blooms are acknowledged
  to play important roles in carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur cycling, yet little information
  is available on their identities or phylogenetic affiliations. Three culture-independent
  methods were used to characterize bacteria from a dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP)-producing
  algal bloom in the North Atlantic. Group-specific 16S rRNA-targeted oligonucleotides,
  16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) clone libraries, and terminal restriction fragment length
  polymorphism analysis all indicated that the marine Roseobacter lineage was numerically
  important in the heterotrophic bacterial community, averaging textgreater20% of
  the 16S rDNA sampled. Two other groups of heterotrophic bacteria, the SAR86 and
  SAR11 clades, were also shown by the three 16S rRNA-based methods to be abundant
  in the bloom community. In surface waters, the Roseobacter , SAR86, and SAR11 lineages
  together accounted for over 50% of the bacterial rDNA and showed little spatial
  variability in abundance despite variations in the dominant algal species. Depth
  profiles indicated that Roseobacter phylotype abundance decreased with depth and
  was positively correlated with chlorophyll a , DMSP, and total organic sulfur (dimethyl
  sulfide plus DMSP plus dimethyl sulfoxide) concentrations. Based on these data and
  previous physiological studies of cultured Roseobacter strains, we hypothesize that
  this lineage plays a role in cycling organic sulfur compounds produced within the
  bloom. Three other abundant bacterial phylotypes (representing a cyanobacterium
  and two members of the α Proteobacteria ) were primarily associated with chlorophyll-rich
  surface waters of the bloom (0 to 50 m), while two others (representing Cytophagales
  and δ Proteobacteria ) were primarily found in deeper waters (200 to 500 m).
