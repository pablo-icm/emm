abstract: We performed a transplant experiment in eutrophic Sau reservoir to assess
  the factors that control bacterial abundance, activity, growth rate, and community
  composition. Samples from the lacustrine and the riverine ends of the reservoir
  were incubated in dialysis bags placed in situ and transplanted to the other side
  of the reservoir and also incubated after 1 µm filtration to measure predator effects.
  The bags were sampled at 12‐h intervals to estimate bacterial abundance, whole community
  activity, activity structure (by flow cytometry), and phylogenetic composition (by
  in situ hybridization with group‐specific phylogenetic probes). Bacterial production
  was always regulated by nutrient supply, but abundance and activity were differently
  regulated at both sites. The riverine bacteria were limited by predator activity,
  whereas the lacustrine were regulated by a combination of predation  and nutrient
  supply. Therefore, even in the same environment, different modes of control can
  act simultaneously. Bacterial activity structure was also regulated in the same
  way. Abundance of high DNA bacteria and cells hybridizing with the universal EUB338
  probe were well correlated. In the lacustrine sample, bacterial community structure
  did not change significantly, whereas in the riverine sample, Α‐ and Δ‐Proteobacteria
  reduced their growth when transplanted, whereas Β‐Proteobacteria were stimulated
  by the presence of predators. Members of the Cytophaga/Flavobacterium phylum grew
  only when incubated in situ in the absence of predators. This different behavior
  in the different bacterial groups resulted in strong changes in bacterial assemblage
  composition, evident already after 24 h. The experiment demonstrates that, together
  with the effect of predators, nutrient supply affects bacterial community properties
  and that a complex regulation involving both types of control can occur in a single
  heterogeneous planktonic system.
