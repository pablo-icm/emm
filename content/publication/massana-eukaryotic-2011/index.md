abstract: The eukaryotic picoplankton is a heterogeneous collection of small protists
  1 to 3 μm in size populating surface oceans at abundances of 10 2 to 10 4 cells
  ml −1 . Pigmented cells are important primary producers that are at the base of
  food webs. Colorless cells are mostly bacterivores and play key roles in channeling
  bacteria to higher trophic levels as well as in nutrient recycling. Mixotrophy and
  parasitism are relevant but less investigated trophic paths. Molecular surveys of
  picoeukaryotes have unveiled a large phylogenetic diversity and new lineages, and
  it is critical to understand the ecological and evolutionary significance of this
  large and novel diversity. A main goal is to assess how individuals are organized
  in taxonomic units and how they participate in ecological processes. Picoeukaryotes
  are convincingly integral members of marine ecosystems in terms of cell abundance,
  biomass, activity, and diversity and they play crucial roles in food webs and biogeochemical
  cycles.
