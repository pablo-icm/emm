abstract: The global ocean genome (the pool of genes in marine organisms and the functional
  information they encode) is a major, untapped resource for science and society with
  a growing range of biotechnology applications in sectors such as biomedicine, energy,
  and food. Shotgun sequencing and metagenomics can now be used to catalog the diversity
  of ocean microbial life and to explore its functional potential, but has been limited
  by sample coverage, access to suitable sequencing platforms, and computational capacity.
  Here we provide a novel synthesis of the global ocean genome based on analysis of
  2,102 sampled ocean metagenomes, with gene assembly and annotation via the KAUST
  Metagenome Analysis Platform (KMAP) Global Ocean Gene Catalog 1.0 containing 308.6
  million gene clusters. Taxonomically, we report the distribution of marine genes
  across the tree of life and different ocean basins and depth zone biomes. Functionally,
  we map its relationship to protein families and biogeochemical processes, including
  the major microbial metabolic pathways that process three elements that play fundamental
  roles in biogeochemical cycles and are relevant to climate change. These data extend
  our understanding of the complex, dynamic nature of the ocean microbiome and its
  metabolic capabilities. Further research is of critical global importance both to
  unlock the potential of the ocean genome and to understand and predict the effects
  of human-induced changes, including pollution and climate change. Further hypothesis-driven
  research should target under-sampled deep sea and benthic microbial communities
  using enhanced metagenomic methods, to better understand marine ecosystem functioning.
  Investment in the necessary computational capacity is essential, as are suitable
  intellectual property frameworks.
