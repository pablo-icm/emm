abstract: Isoprene is a biogenic trace gas produced by terrestrial vegetation and
  marine phytoplankton. In the remote oceans, where secondary aerosols are mostly
  biogenic, marine isoprene emissions affect atmospheric chemistry and influence cloud
  formation and brightness. Here, we present the first compilation of new and published
  measurements of isoprene concentrations in the Southern Ocean and explore their
  distribution patterns. Surface ocean isoprene concentrations in November through
  April span 1 to 94 pM. A band of higher concentrations is observed around a latitude
  of ≈40     ∘     S and a surface sea temperature of 15      ∘    C. High isoprene
  also occurs in high productivity waters near islands and continental coasts. We
  use concurrent measurements of physical, chemical, and biological variables to explore
  the main potential drivers of isoprene concentration by means of paired regressions
  and multivariate analysis. Isoprene is best explained by phytoplankton-related variables
  like the concentrations of chlorophyll-a, photoprotective pigments and particulate
  organic matter, photosynthetic efficiency (influenced by iron availability), and
  the chlorophyll-a shares of most phytoplankton groups, and not by macronutrients
  or bacterial abundance. A simple statistical model based on chlorophyll-a concentration
  and a sea surface temperature discontinuity accounts for half of the variance of
  isoprene concentrations in surface waters of the Southern Ocean.
