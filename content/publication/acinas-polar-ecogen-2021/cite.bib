 abstract = {Changes occurring in polar areas significantly affect climate dynamics at other latitudes and global climate processes. Microorganisms are the foundation of the marine food web, as such we need to understand how they adapt and thrive, as well as forecast their fate in a future ocean impacted by anthropogenic change. Predicting the future of polar ecosystems requires understanding the responses of polar microorganisms to environmental change, as they are the main drivers of global biogeochemical cycles. However, little is known about the ecology, metabolic potential and activity or evolution of microbes in polar Oceans at the highest resolution possible: at genome level. We recently analyzed Arctic seawater metagenomes and metatranscriptomes collected at various depths and different seasons during the Tara Oceans Polar Circle expedition. This effort resulted in 3,550 metagenomic bins, of which 530 correspond to Metagenome Assembled Genomes (MAGs) that make up the first Arctic MAGs genome catalogue. This Arctic genome catalogue is constituted by 526 different species, of which 83% are novel, with 60% of genomes showing an exclusively polar distribution.

The project POLAR_EcoGen relies on this unique uncultured Arctic genome dataset together with existing and new samples from Arctic and Antarctic cruises from national and international collaborations. The general aim of the project POLAR_EcoGen is the exploration of the polar microbiome, by studying the ecology, functional characterization and evolution processes of key uncultured prokaryotic microorganisms from Arctic and Antarctic oceans. The proposal Polar_EcoGen is focused in four main objectives: 1) Generation of the Polar Prokaryotes Genomes Catalogue, a dataset of reference for microbial studies of polar ecosystems 2) Visual quantification by CARD-FISH hybridization of novel polar bacteria and archaea taxa derived from MAGs and Single Cell Genomes (SAGs) containing 16S rRNA gene; 2) Metabolic characterization and experimental assessment to unveil the contribution of selected uncultured polar prokaryotes to chemolithoautotrophy or mixotrophy; 3) Delineation of relevant ecologically genomics units (EGUs) by sequencing a large number of SAGs from Tara Oceans Polar and other expeditions from Antarctic waters. Altogether, this proposal would represent a significant advance in our knowledge of the ecology, metabolic capabilities and evolution of uncultured key bacteria and archaea species in the polar seawater ecosystems some of which might be more susceptible to the effects of climate change due to their restricted niche breadth. Our results would be relevant for future design of monitoring, experiments and ecosystem models in this rapidly changing environment.},
