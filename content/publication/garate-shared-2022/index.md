abstract: Abstract  Pico‐ and nanoplankton are key players in the marine ecosystems
  due to their implication in the biogeochemical cycles, nutrient recycling and the
  pelagic food webs. However, the specific dynamics and niches of most bacterial,
  archaeal and eukaryotic plankton remain unknown, as well as the interactions between
  them. Better characterization of these is critical for understanding and predicting
  ecosystem functioning under anthropogenic pressures. We used environmental DNA metabarcoding
  across a 6‐year time series to explore the structure and seasonality of pico‐ and
  nanoplankton communities in two sites of the Bay of Biscay, one coastal and one
  offshore, and construct association networks to reveal potential keystone and connector
  taxa. Temporal trends in alpha diversity were similar between the two sites, and
  concurrent communities more similar than within the same site at different times.
  However, we found differences between the network topologies of the two sites, with
  both shared and site‐specific keystones and connectors. For example, Micromonas
  , with lower abundance in the offshore site is a keystone here, indicating a stronger
  effect of associations such as resource competition. This study provides an example
  of how time series and association network analysis can reveal how similar communities
  may function differently despite being geographically close.
