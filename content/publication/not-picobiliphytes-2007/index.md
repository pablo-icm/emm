abstract: Environmental sequencing has revealed unimagined diversity among eukaryotic
  picoplankton. A distinct picoplanktonic algal group, initially detected from 18
  S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) sequences, was hybridized with rRNA λ-targeted (rRNA-targeted)
  probes, detected by tyramide signal amplification–fluorescent in situ hybridization,
  and showed an organelle-like body with orange fluorescence indicative of phycobilins.
  Using this fluorescence signal, cells were sorted by flow cytometry and probed.
  Hybridized cells contained a 4′,6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole–stained organelle resembling
  a plastid with a nucleomorph. This suggests that they may be secondary endosymbiotic
  algae. Pending the isolation of living cells and their formal description, these
  algae have been termed picobiliphytes.
