abstract: 'Sea spray aerosol (SSA) formation plays a major role in the climate system.
  The Antarctic Peninsula (AP) is affected by the greatest warming occurring in the
  Southern Ocean; changes in cryospheric and biological processes are being observed.
  Whilst there is some evidence that organic material produced by ice algae and/or
  phytoplankton in the high Arctic contributes to SSA, less is known about Antarctic
  Sea ice (sympagic) regions. To gain insight into the influence of Antarctic Sea
  ice biology and biogeochemistry on atmospheric aerosol, we report simultaneous water-air
  measurements made by means of in situ aerosol chamber experiments. For the first
  time, we present a methodology showing that the controlled plunging jet aerosol
  chamber settings do not cause major cell disruption on the studied sea ice ecosystems.
  Larger sea ice phytoplankton cells (&gt;20 µm; mainly diatoms) tend to sediment
  at the bottom of the chamber (during the 24h experiment) and likely have a minor
  role on SSA production. When comparing four chamber experiments - we find that the
  two producing more SSA are the ones with highest abundance of nanophytoplankton
  cells (&lt;20 µm; mainly nanoflagellates) as well as viruses. Our marine biogeochemical
  data show two broad groups of dissolved organic carbon: one rich in carbohydrates
  and proteic material and one rich in humic-like substances; the latter enhancing
  SSA production. This work provides unique insights into sea ice productivity that
  modulates SSA production, with potentially significant climate impacts. Further
  studies of these types are advised in order to see how microbiology impacts the
  biogeochemical cycling of elements and how aerosols are formed and processed in
  cold regions.'
