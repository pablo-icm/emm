abstract: Summary  Viruses are known as important mortality agents of marine microorganisms.
  Most studies focus on bacterial and algal viruses, and few reports exist on viruses
  infecting marine heterotrophic protists. Here we show results from several incubations
  initiated with a microbial assemblage from the central Indian Ocean and amended
  with different amounts of organic matter. Heterotrophic flagellates developed up
  to 30 000 cells ml −1 in the most enriched incubation. A 18S rDNA clone library
  and fluorescent in situ hybridization counts with newly designed probes indicated
  that the peak was formed by Cafeteria roenbergensis and Caecitellus paraparvulus
  (90% and 10% of the cells respectively). Both taxa were below detection in the original
  sample, indicating a strong positive selective bias during the enrichment. During
  the peak, C. roenbergensis cells were observed with virus‐like particles in the
  cytoplasm, and 4 days later this taxa could not be detected. Transmission electron
  microscopy confirmed the viral nature of these particles, which were large (280 nm),
  had double‐stranded DNA, and were produced with a burst size of ∼70. This virus
  was specific of C. roenbergensis as neither C. paraparvulus that was never seen
  infected, nor other flagellate taxa that developed in later stages of the incubation,
  appeared attacked. This is one of the few reports on a heterotrophic flagellate
  virus and the implications of this finding in the Indian Ocean are discussed.
