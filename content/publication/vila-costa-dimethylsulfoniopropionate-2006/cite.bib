 abstract = {Dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) accounts for most of the organic sulfur fluxes from primary to secondary producers in marine microbial food webs. Incubations of natural communities and axenic cultures with radio-labeled DMSP showed that dominant phytoplankton groups of the ocean, the unicellular cyanobacteria
Prochlorococcus
and
Synechococcus
and diatoms, as well as heterotrophic bacteria take up and assimilate DMSP sulfur, thus diverting a proportion of plankton-produced organic sulfur from emission into the atmosphere.},
