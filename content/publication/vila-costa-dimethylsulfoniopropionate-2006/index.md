abstract: Dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) accounts for most of the organic sulfur
  fluxes from primary to secondary producers in marine microbial food webs. Incubations
  of natural communities and axenic cultures with radio-labeled DMSP showed that dominant
  phytoplankton groups of the ocean, the unicellular cyanobacteria Prochlorococcus
  and Synechococcus and diatoms, as well as heterotrophic bacteria take up and assimilate
  DMSP sulfur, thus diverting a proportion of plankton-produced organic sulfur from
  emission into the atmosphere.
