abstract: Summary  Molecular surveys of marine picoeukaryotes have revealed a large
  number of sequences unrelated to cultured organisms, such as those forming the marine
  stramenopile (MAST)‐4 clade. Recent FISH (fluorescent in situ hybridization) data
  have shown that MAST‐4 cells are uncultured heterotrophic flagellates of 2–3 μm
  in size that have a global distribution in non‐polar marine waters. However, FISH
  is time‐consuming and hard to apply to the many samples generated during oceanographic
  cruises, so we developed a real‐time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (Q‐PCR)
  protocol to determine rapidly the abundance of this group using environmental DNA.
  We designed a primer set targeting the 18S rRNA genes (rDNA) of MAST‐4 and optimized
  and calibrated the Q‐PCR protocol using a plasmid with the target sequence as insert.
  The Q‐PCR was then applied to quantify MAST‐4 rDNA molecules along three marine
  transects, longitudinal in the Indian Ocean, latitudinal in the Drake Passage and
  coastal–offshore in the Mediterranean Sea, and to a temporal study in a Mediterranean
  Sea coastal station. MAST‐4 was detected in all samples processed (averaged abundances
  between 500 and 1000 rDNA molecules ml −1 ) except in mesopelagic and Antarctic
  samples, where it was virtually absent. In general, it was more abundant in the
  coast than offshore and in the deep chlorophyll maximum than at surface. A comparison
  of Q‐PCR and FISH signals in well‐controlled microbial incubations indicated that
  MAST‐4 cells have around 30 copies of the rDNA operon. This Q‐PCR assay quickly
  yielded quantitative data of uncultured MAST‐4 cells and confirmed their wide distribution
  and putative ecological importance.
