abstract: Abstract Perkinsea constitutes a lineage within the Alveolata eukaryotic
  superphylum, mainly composed of parasitic organisms. Some described species represent
  significant ecological and economic threats due to their invasive ability and pathogenicity,
  which can lead to mortality events. However, the genetic diversity of these described
  species is just the tip of the iceberg. Environmental surveys targeting this lineage
  are still scarce and mainly limited to the Northern Hemisphere. Here, we aim to
  conduct an in depth exploration of the Perkinsea group, uncovering the diversity
  across a variety of environments, including those beyond freshwater and marine ecosystems.
  We seek to identify and describe putative novel organisms based on their genetic
  signatures. In this study, we conducted an extensive analysis of a metabarcoding
  dataset, focusing on the V4 region of the 18S rRNA gene (the EukBank dataset), to
  investigate the diversity, distribution and environmental preferences of the Perkinsea.
  Our results reveal a remarkable diversity within the Perkinsea, with 1568 Amplicon
  Sequence Variants (ASVs) identified across thousands of environmental samples. Surprisingly,
  we showed a substantial diversity of Perkinsea within soil samples (269 ASVs), challenging
  the previous assumption that this group is confined to marine and freshwater environments.
  In addition, we revealed that a notable proportion of Perkinsea ASVs (428 ASVs)
  could correspond to putative new organisms, encompassing the well-established taxonomic
  group Perkinsidae. Finally, our study shed light on previously unveiled taxonomic
  groups, including the Xcellidae, and revealed their environmental distribution.
  These findings demonstrate that Perkinsea exhibits far greater diversity than previously
  detected and surprisingly extends beyond marine and freshwater environments. The
  meta-analysis conducted in this study has unveiled the existence of previously unknown
  clusters within the Perkinsea lineage, solely identified based on their genetic
  signatures. Considering the ecological and economic importance of described Perkinsea
  species, these results suggest that Perkinsea may play a significant, yet previously
  unrecognized, role across a wide range of environments, spanning from soil environments
  to the abyssal zone of the open ocean with important implications for ecosystem
  functioning.
