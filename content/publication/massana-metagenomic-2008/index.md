abstract: Summary The aim of this study was to explore the use of large-scale sequencing
  to better describe the genome content of naturally occurring, uncultured protists.
  We constructed a metagenomic fosmid library from a picoplanktonic assemblage (0.2–3 μm
  size cells) collected at the Blanes Bay Microbial Observatory (Western Mediterranean).
  Seven clones contained a small-subunit ribosomal RNA gene (SSU rDNA) affiliating
  with prasinophytes and uncultured alveolates. One clone (FBB25; 35 kb in size) was
  completely sequenced and found to be a tandem repeat array (5.5 times) of the rDNA
  operon, including three rRNA genes (SSU, large-subunit and 5.8S rDNAs) and three
  spacer regions (internal transcribed spacers 1, 2 and intergenic spacer). The SSU
  rDNA of FBB25 affiliated with the marine alveolates group I, cluster 1, and was
  almost identical to sequences retrieved only in marine surveys from a wide geographic
  and ecological range. Phylogenetic trees using the different rRNA genes showed FBB25
  as an independent branch among the main alveolate groups, but their closest affiliation
  varied between the SSU tree (dinoflagellates) and the large-subunit and 5.8S trees
  (perkinsids). The spacer regions of FBB25 were particularly short when compared
  with other eukaryotes, indicating a possible genome streamlining in this picoeukaryote.
  Finally, not a single polymorphism was found in the rDNA repeat array, suggesting
  that the high SSU rDNA variability typically found in molecular surveys derives
  from organismal and not intragenomic diversity. This first report on the rDNA genomic
  structure of an uncultured marine alveolate improves their phylogenetic position
  and helps interpreting data generated during picoeukaryotic molecular surveys.
