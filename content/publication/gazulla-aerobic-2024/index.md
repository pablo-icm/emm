abstract: Abstract  Aerobic anoxygenic phototrophic (AAP) bacteria are a common part
  of microbial communities in the sunlit ocean. They contain bacteriochlorophyll a
  (BChl a )‐based photosystems that harvest solar energy for their metabolism. Across
  different oceanic regions, AAP bacteria seem to be more abundant in eutrophic areas,
  associated with high chlorophyll concentrations. While most previous studies focused
  on surface samplings, there is limited information regarding their vertical distribution
  in euphotic zones of the major ocean basins. Here, we hypothesized that AAP bacteria
  will follow a similar structure to the chlorophyll depth profile across areas with
  different degrees of stratification. To test this hypothesis, we enumerated AAP
  cells and determined bulk water BChl a concentrations along the photic zone of a
  latitudinal transect in the South and Central Atlantic Ocean. Overall, the distribution
  of AAP bacteria was highly correlated to that of chlorophyll a and to the abundance
  of picophytoplankton across both vertical and horizontal gradients. Furthermore,
  estimated light energy captured across the water column showed that, while AAP bacteria
  share a common latitudinal pattern of light absorption with picophytoplankton, they
  display a unique vertical arrangement with highest photoheterotrophic activity in
  the top 50 m of the surface ocean.
