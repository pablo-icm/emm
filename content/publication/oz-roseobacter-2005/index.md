abstract: ABSTRACT  Bacteriochlorophyll a -containing aerobic anoxygenic phototrophs
  (AAnP) have been proposed to account for up to 11% of the total surface water microbial
  community and to potentially have great ecological importance in the world's oceans.
  Recently, environmental and genomic data based on analysis of the pufM gene identified
  the existence of α-proteobacteria as well as possible γ-like proteobacteria among
  AAnP in the Pacific Ocean. Here we report on analyses of environmental samples from
  the Red and Mediterranean Seas by using pufM as well as the bchX and bchL genes
  as molecular markers. The majority of photosynthesis genes retrieved from these
  seas were related to Roseobacter -like AAnP sequences. Furthermore, the sequence
  of a novel photosynthetic operon organization from an uncultured Roseobacter -like
  bacterial artificial chromosome retrieved from the Red Sea is described. The data
  show the presence of Roseobacter -like bacteria in Red and Mediterranean Sea AAnP
  populations in the seasons analyzed.
