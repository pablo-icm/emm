Bacteriochlorophyll
a
-containing aerobic anoxygenic phototrophs (AAnP) have been proposed to account for up to 11% of the total surface water microbial community and to potentially have great ecological importance in the world's oceans. Recently, environmental and genomic data based on analysis of the
pufM
gene identified the existence of α-proteobacteria as well as possible γ-like proteobacteria among AAnP in the Pacific Ocean. Here we report on analyses of environmental samples from the Red and Mediterranean Seas by using
pufM
as well as the
bchX
and
bchL
genes as molecular markers. The majority of photosynthesis genes retrieved from these seas were related to
Roseobacter
-like AAnP sequences. Furthermore, the sequence of a novel photosynthetic operon organization from an uncultured
Roseobacter
-like bacterial artificial chromosome retrieved from the Red Sea is described. The data show the presence of
Roseobacter
-like bacteria in Red and Mediterranean Sea AAnP populations in the seasons analyzed.},
