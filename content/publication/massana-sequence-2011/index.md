abstract: Abstract Despite the ecological importance of marine pico-size eukaryotes,
  the study of their in situ diversity using molecular tools started just a few years
  ago. These studies have revealed that marine picoeukaryotes are very diverse and
  include many novel taxa. However, the amount and structure of their phylogenetic
  diversity and the extent of their sequence novelty still remains poorly known, as
  a systematic analysis has been seldom attempted. In this study, we use a coherent
  and carefully curated data set of 500 published 18S ribosomal DNA sequences to quantify
  the diversity and novelty patterns of picoeukaryotes in the Indian Ocean. Our phylogenetic
  tree showed many distant lineages. We grouped sequences in OTUs (operational taxonomic
  units) at discrete values delineated by pair-wise Jukes–Cantor (JC) distances and
  tree patristic distances. At a distance of 0.01, the number of OTUs observed (237/242;
  using JC or patristic distances, respectively) was half the number of sequences
  analyzed, indicating the existence of microdiverse clusters of highly related sequences.
  At this distance level, we estimated 600–800 OTUs using several statistical methods.
  The number of OTUs observed was still substantial at higher distances (39/82 at
  0.20 distance) suggesting a large diversity at high-taxonomic ranks. Most sequences
  were related to marine clones from other sites and many were distant to cultured
  organisms, highlighting the huge culturing gap within protists. The novelty analysis
  indicated the putative presence of pseudogenes and of truly novel high-rank phylogenetic
  lineages. The identified diversity and novelty patterns among marine picoeukaryotes
  are of great importance for understanding and interpreting their ecology and evolution.
