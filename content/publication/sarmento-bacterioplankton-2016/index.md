abstract: Abstract Some prokaryotes are known to be specialized in the use of phytoplankton-derived
  dissolved organic carbon (DOCp) originated by exudation or cell lysis; however,
  direct quantification measurements are extremely rare. Several studies have described
  bacterial selectivity based on DOCp quality, but very few have focused on the quantity
  of DOCp, and the relative importance of each of these variables (for example, quantity
  versus quality) on prokaryote responses. We applied an adapted version of the MAR-FISH
  (microautoradiography coupled with catalyzed reporter deposition fluorescence in
  situ hybridization) protocol using radiolabelled exudates from axenic algal cultures
  to calculate a specialization index (d’) for large bacterioplankton phylogenetic
  groups using DOCp from different phytoplankton species and at different concentrations
  to elucidate to what extent the bacterial response to DOCp is driven by resource
  quantity (different DOCp concentrations) or by quality (DOCp from different phytoplankton
  species). All bacterial phylogenetic groups studied had lower d’ at higher DOCp
  concentration, indicating more generalist behavior at higher resource availabilities.
  Indeed, at increasing resource concentrations, most bacterial groups incorporated
  DOCp indiscriminately, regardless of its origin (or quality). At low resource concentrations,
  only some specialists were able to actively incorporate the various types of organic
  matter effectively. The variability of bacterial responses to different treatments
  was systematically higher at varying concentrations than at varying DOCp types,
  suggesting that, at least for this range of concentrations (10–100 μM), DOCp quantity
  affects bacterial responses more than quality does. Therefore, resource quantity
  may be more relevant than resource quality in the bacterial responses to DOCp and
  affect how bacterioplankton use phytoplankton-derived carbon.
