abstract: ABSTRACT An annual seasonal cycle of composition of a bacterioplankton community
  in an oligotrophic coastal system was studied by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis
  (DGGE) using five different primer sets. Analysis of DGGE fingerprints showed that
  primer set 357fGC-907rM grouped samples according to seasons. Additionally, we used
  the set of 16S rRNA genes archived in the RDPII database to check the percentage
  of perfect matches of each primer for the most abundant bacterial groups inhabiting
  coastal plankton communities. Overall, primer set 357fGC-907rM was the most suitable
  for the routine use of PCR-DGGE analyses in this environment.
