abstract: We explored how changes of viral abundance and community composition among
  four contrasting regions in the Southern Ocean relied on physicochemical and microbiological
  traits. During January–February 2015, we visited areas north and south of the South
  Orkney Islands (NSO and SSO) characterized by low temperature and salinity and high
  inorganic nutrient concentration, north of South Georgia Island (NSG) and west of
  Anvers Island (WA), which have relatively higher temperatures and lower inorganic
  nutrient concentrations. Surface viral abundance (VA) was highest in NSG (21.50
  ± 10.70 × 106 viruses mL−1) and lowest in SSO (2.96 ± 1.48 × 106 viruses mL−1).
  VA was positively correlated with temperature, prokaryote abundance and prokaryotic
  heterotrophic production, chlorophyll a, diatoms, haptophytes, fluorescent organic
  matter, and isoprene concentration, and was negatively correlated with inorganic
  nutrients (NO3−, SiO42−, PO43−), and dimethyl sulfide (DMS) concentrations. Viral
  communities determined by randomly amplified polymorphic DNA–polymerase chain reaction
  (RAPD-PCR) were grouped according to the sampling location, being more similar within
  them than among regions. The first two axes of a canonical correspondence analysis,
  including physicochemical (temperature, salinity, inorganic nutrients—NO3−, SiO42−,
  and dimethyl sulfoniopropionate -DMSP- and isoprene concentrations) and microbiological
  (chlorophyll a, haptophytes and diatom, and prokaryote abundance and prokaryotic
  heterotrophic production) factors accounted for 62.9% of the variance. The first
  axis, temperature-related, accounted for 33.8%; the second one, salinity-related,
  accounted for 29.1%. Thus, different environmental situations likely select different
  hosts for viruses, leading to distinct viral communities.
