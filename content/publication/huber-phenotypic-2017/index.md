abstract: Summary  Picocyanobacteria can occur as single‐cell (Pcy) or as colonies
  (CPcy). Published evidence suggests that some Pcy strains have the capability to
  aggregate under certain culture conditions, however this has not been demonstrated
  to occur in natural environments. We investigated whether the Pcy and CPcy belong
  to the same species (i.e. phylotype), and the factors that determine their morphological
  and genetic variability in a hypertrophic shallow lake dominated by picocyanobacteria.
  Six main different morphologies and textgreater30 phylotypes were observed. All
  sequences retrieved belonged to the ‘ Anathece + Cyanobium ’ clade (Synechococcales)
  that are known to have the capability of aggregation/disaggregation. The temporal
  variation of picocyanobacteria morphotype composition was weakly correlated with
  the DGGE temporal pattern, and could be explained by the composition of the zooplankton
  assemblage. Laboratory experiments confirmed that the small cladoceran Bosmina favoured
  the dominance of CPcy, i.e. Cyanodictyon doubled the size of the colonies when present,
  most likely through the aggregation of single‐cell picocyanobacteria into colonies.
  Flow cytometry cell sorting and 16S rRNA + ITS sequencing of the Pcy and CPcy cytometrically‐defined
  populations revealed that some phylotypes could be found in both sorted populations,
  suggesting phenotypic plasticity in which various Synechococcales phylotypes could
  be found in situ either as single‐cells or as colonies.
