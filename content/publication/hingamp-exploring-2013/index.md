abstract: Abstract Nucleo-cytoplasmic large DNA viruses (NCLDVs) constitute a group
  of eukaryotic viruses that can have crucial ecological roles in the sea by accelerating
  the turnover of their unicellular hosts or by causing diseases in animals. To better
  characterize the diversity, abundance and biogeography of marine NCLDVs, we analyzed
  17 metagenomes derived from microbial samples (0.2–1.6 μm size range) collected
  during the Tara Oceans Expedition. The sample set includes ecosystems under-represented
  in previous studies, such as the Arabian Sea oxygen minimum zone (OMZ) and Indian
  Ocean lagoons. By combining computationally derived relative abundance and direct
  prokaryote cell counts, the abundance of NCLDVs was found to be in the order of
  104–105 genomes ml−1 for the samples from the photic zone and 102–103 genomes ml−1
  for the OMZ. The Megaviridae and Phycodnaviridae dominated the NCLDV populations
  in the metagenomes, although most of the reads classified in these families showed
  large divergence from known viral genomes. Our taxon co-occurrence analysis revealed
  a potential association between viruses of the Megaviridae family and eukaryotes
  related to oomycetes. In support of this predicted association, we identified six
  cases of lateral gene transfer between Megaviridae and oomycetes. Our results suggest
  that marine NCLDVs probably outnumber eukaryotic organisms in the photic layer (per
  given water mass) and that metagenomic sequence analyses promise to shed new light
  on the biodiversity of marine viruses and their interactions with potential hosts.
