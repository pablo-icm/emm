abstract: Abstract The osmotrophic uptake of dissolved organic compounds in the ocean
  is considered to be dominated by heterotrophic prokaryotes, whereas the role of
  planktonic eukaryotes is still unclear. We explored the capacity of natural eukaryotic
  plankton communities to incorporate the synthetic amino acid L-homopropargylglycine
  (HPG, analogue of methionine) using biorthogonal noncanonical amino acid tagging
  (BONCAT), and we compared it with prokaryotic HPG use throughout a 9-day survey
  in the NW Mediterranean. BONCAT allows to fluorescently identify translationally
  active cells, but it has never been applied to natural eukaryotic communities. We
  found a large diversity of photosynthetic and heterotrophic eukaryotes incorporating
  HPG into proteins, with dinoflagellates and diatoms showing the highest percentages
  of BONCAT-labelled cells (49 ± 25% and 52 ± 15%, respectively). Among them, pennate
  diatoms exhibited higher HPG incorporation in the afternoon than in the morning,
  whereas small (≤5 μm) photosynthetic eukaryotes and heterotrophic nanoeukaryotes
  showed the opposite pattern. Centric diatoms (e.g. Chaetoceros, Thalassiosira, and
  Lauderia spp.) dominated the eukaryotic HPG incorporation due to their high abundances
  and large sizes, accounting for up to 86% of the eukaryotic BONCAT signal and strongly
  correlating with bulk 3H-leucine uptake rates. When including prokaryotes, eukaryotes
  were estimated to account for 19–31% of the bulk BONCAT signal. Our results evidence
  a large complexity in the osmotrophic uptake of HPG, which varies over time within
  and across eukaryotic groups and highlights the potential of BONCAT to quantify
  osmotrophy and protein synthesis in complex eukaryotic communities.
