abstract: Abstract  Background Ocean microbes constitute ~ 70% of the marine biomass,
  are responsible for ~ 50% of the Earth’s primary production and are crucial for
  global biogeochemical cycles. Marine microbiotas include core taxa that are usually
  key for ecosystem function. Despite their importance, core marine microbes are relatively
  unknown, which reflects the lack of consensus on how to identify them. So far, most
  core microbiotas have been defined based on species occurrence and abundance. Yet,
  species interactions are also important to identify core microbes, as communities
  include interacting species. Here, we investigate interconnected bacteria and small
  protists of the core pelagic microbiota populating a long-term marine-coastal observatory
  in the Mediterranean Sea over a decade.   Results Core microbes were defined as
  those present in textgreater 30% of the monthly samples over 10 years, with the
  strongest associations. The core microbiota included 259 Operational Taxonomic Units
  (OTUs) including 182 bacteria, 77 protists, and 1411 strong and mostly positive
  (~ 95%) associations. Core bacteria tended to be associated with other bacteria,
  while core protists tended to be associated with bacteria. The richness and abundance
  of core OTUs varied annually, decreasing in stratified warmers waters and increasing
  in colder mixed waters. Most core OTUs had a preference for one season, mostly winter,
  which featured subnetworks with the highest connectivity. Groups of highly associated
  taxa tended to include protists and bacteria with predominance in the same season,
  particularly winter. A group of 13 highly-connected hub-OTUs, with potentially important
  ecological roles dominated in winter and spring. Similarly, 18 connector OTUs with
  a low degree but high centrality were mostly associated with summer or autumn and
  may represent transitions between seasonal communities.   Conclusions We found a
  relatively small and dynamic interconnected core microbiota in a model temperate
  marine-coastal site, with potential interactions being more deterministic in winter
  than in other seasons. These core microbes would be essential for the functioning
  of this ecosystem over the year. Other non-core taxa may also carry out important
  functions but would be redundant and non-essential. Our work contributes to the
  understanding of the dynamics and potential interactions of core microbes possibly
  sustaining ocean ecosystem function.
