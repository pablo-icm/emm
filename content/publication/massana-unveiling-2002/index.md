abstract: ABSTRACT Despite the fact that the smallest eukaryotes (cells less than
  5 μm in diameter) play key roles in marine food webs, particularly in open oligotrophic
  areas, the study of their in situ diversity started just one year ago. Perhaps the
  most remarkable finding of the most recent studies has been the discovery of completely
  new phylogenetic lineages, such as novel clades belonging to the stramenopile and
  alveolate phyla. The two new groups account for a significant fraction of clones
  in genetic libraries from North Atlantic, equatorial Pacific, Antarctic, and Mediterranean
  Sea waters. However, the identities and ecological relevance of these organisms
  remain unknown. Here we investigate the phylogenetic relationships, morphology,
  in situ abundance, and ecological role of novel stramenopiles. They form at least
  eight independent clades within the stramenopile basal branches, indicating a large
  phylogenetic diversity within the group. Two lineages were visualized and enumerated
  in field samples and enrichments by fluorescent in situ hybridization using specific
  rRNA-targeted oligonucleotide probes. The targeted organisms were 2- to 3-μm-diameter,
  round-shaped, nonpigmented flagellates. Further, they were found to be bacterivorous.
  One lineage accounted for up to 46% (average during an annual cycle, 19%) of heterotrophic
  flagellates in a coastal environment, providing evidence that novel stramenopiles
  are important and unrecognized components of the total stock of bacterial grazers.
