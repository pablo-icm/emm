abstract: Abstract Deep ocean microbial communities rely on the organic carbon produced
  in the sunlit ocean, yet it remains unknown whether surface processes determine
  the assembly and function of bathypelagic prokaryotes to a larger extent than deep‐sea
  physicochemical conditions. Here, we explored whether variations in surface phytoplankton
  assemblages across Atlantic, Pacific and Indian ocean stations can explain structural
  changes in bathypelagic (ca. 4,000 m) free‐living and particle‐attached prokaryotic
  communities (characterized through 16S rRNA gene sequencing), as well as changes
  in prokaryotic activity and dissolved organic matter (DOM) quality. We show that
  the spatial structuring of prokaryotic communities in the bathypelagic strongly
  followed variations in the abundances of surface dinoflagellates and ciliates, as
  well as gradients in surface primary productivity, but were less influenced by bathypelagic
  physicochemical conditions. Amino acid‐like DOM components in the bathypelagic reflected
  variations of those components in surface waters, and seemed to control bathypelagic
  prokaryotic activity. The imprint of surface conditions was more evident in bathypelagic
  than in shallower mesopelagic (200–1,000 m) communities, suggesting a direct connectivity
  through fast‐sinking particles that escape mesopelagic transformations. Finally,
  we identified a pool of endemic deep‐sea prokaryotic taxa (including potentially
  chemoautotrophic groups) that appear less connected to surface processes than those
  bathypelagic taxa with a widespread vertical distribution. Our results suggest that
  surface planktonic communities shape the spatial structure of the bathypelagic microbiome
  to a larger extent than the local physicochemical environment, likely through determining
  the nature of the sinking particles and the associated prokaryotes reaching bathypelagic
  waters.
