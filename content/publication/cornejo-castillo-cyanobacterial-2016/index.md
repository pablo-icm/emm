abstract: Abstract The unicellular cyanobacterium UCYN-A, one of the major contributors
  to nitrogen fixation in the open ocean, lives in symbiosis with single-celled phytoplankton.
  UCYN-A includes several closely related lineages whose partner fidelity, genome-wide
  expression and time of evolutionary divergence remain to be resolved. Here we detect
  and distinguish UCYN-A1 and UCYN-A2 lineages in symbiosis with two distinct prymnesiophyte
  partners in the South Atlantic Ocean. Both symbiotic systems are lineage specific
  and differ in the number of UCYN-A cells involved. Our analyses infer a streamlined
  genome expression towards nitrogen fixation in both UCYN-A lineages. Comparative
  genomics reveal a strong purifying selection in UCYN-A1 and UCYN-A2 with a diversification
  process ∼91 Myr ago, in the late Cretaceous, after the low-nutrient regime period
  occurred during the Jurassic. These findings suggest that UCYN-A diversified in
  a co-evolutionary process, wherein their prymnesiophyte partners acted as a barrier
  driving an allopatric speciation of extant UCYN-A lineages.
