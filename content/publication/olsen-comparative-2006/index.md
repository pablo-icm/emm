abstract: We quantify, compare, and generalize responses of experimental nutrient
  loadings (L N ) on planktonic community structure and function in coastal waters.
  Data were derived from three mesocosm experiments undertaken in Baltic (BAL), Mediterranean
  (MED), and Norwegian (NOR) coastal waters. A planktonic model with seven functional
  compartments and 30–32 different carbon flows fit to all three experiments was used
  as a framework for flow‐rate estimation and comparison. Flows were estimated on
  the basis of time series of measured biomass, some measured flows, and inverse modeling.
  Biomass and gross uptake rate of carbon of most groups increased linearly with increasing
  L N in the nutrient input range of 0–1 µmol N L −1 d −1 at all locations. The fate
  of the gross primary production (GPP) was similar in all systems. Autotrophic biomass
  varied by two orders of magnitude among locations, with the lowest biomass and response
  to nutrient addition in MED waters. The variation of GPP among sites was less than
  one order of magnitude. Mesozooplankton dominated by doliolids (Tunicata), but not
  those dominated by copepods, presumably exerted efficient control of the autotrophic
  biomass, thereby buffering responses of autotrophs to high nutrient input. Among
  the many factors that can modify the responses of autotrophs to nutrients, the time
  scale over which the enrichment is made and the precise mode of nutrient enrichment
  are important. We suggest a general concept that may contribute to a scientific
  basis for understanding and managing coastal eutrophication.
