abstract: 'To be useful in understanding natural communities, the analysis of size
  spectra should reveal seasonal and interlake variability. We calculated size spectra
  for the planktonic community of Lake Cisó. Data from 3 yr were used to analyze seasonal
  patterns of size distribution. The average spectrum showed peaks of biomass at 0.5–0.7,
  4, 15, 32, 64, 85, and 200 µ m of equivalent spherical diameter. These peaks corresponded
  to the dominant organisms in the lake: heterotrophic bacteria, purple phototrophic
  bacteria, Cryptomonas phaseolus, small ciliates including Coleps hirtus, large ciliates,
  rotifers including Anuraeopsis fissa , and copepods. The peak at 4 µ m was the largest
  (3 or more times the biomass of the others). We used these data to test the utility
  of the size spectral approach to describe seasonal changes in the lake. Both linear
  and polynomial equations were fitted to the normalized spectra. Although the slope
  of the linear fit did not show any seasonal trend, the second‐order coefficient
  of the polynomial fit presented a clear pattern that made it a useful index of the
  degree of procaryotic dominance. The lake alternated between anaerobic conditions
  during mixing, when procaryotes dominated and polynomial fits were best, and stratification,
  when polynomial and linear curves fit equally well.'
