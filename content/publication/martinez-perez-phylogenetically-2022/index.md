abstract: Abstract Throughout coastal Antarctica, ice shelves separate oceanic waters
  from sunlight by hundreds of meters of ice. Historical studies have detected activity
  of nitrifying microorganisms in oceanic cavities below permanent ice shelves. However,
  little is known about the microbial composition and pathways that mediate these
  activities. In this study, we profiled the microbial communities beneath the Ross
  Ice Shelf using a multi-omics approach. Overall, beneath-shelf microorganisms are
  of comparable abundance and diversity, though distinct composition, relative to
  those in the open meso- and bathypelagic ocean. Production of new organic carbon
  is likely driven by aerobic lithoautotrophic archaea and bacteria that can use ammonium,
  nitrite, and sulfur compounds as electron donors. Also enriched were aerobic organoheterotrophic
  bacteria capable of degrading complex organic carbon substrates, likely derived
  from in situ fixed carbon and potentially refractory organic matter laterally advected
  by the below-shelf waters. Altogether, these findings uncover a taxonomically distinct
  microbial community potentially adapted to a highly oligotrophic marine environment
  and suggest that ocean cavity waters are primarily chemosynthetically-driven systems.
