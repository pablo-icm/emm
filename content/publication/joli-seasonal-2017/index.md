abstract: Abstract Prasinophytes occur in all oceans but rarely dominate phytoplankton
  populations. In contrast, a single ecotype of the prasinophyte Micromonas is frequently
  the most abundant photosynthetic taxon reported in the Arctic from summer through
  autumn. However, seasonal dynamics of prasinophytes outside of this period are little
  known. To address this, we analyzed high-throughput V4 18S rRNA amplicon data collected
  from November to July in the Amundsen Gulf Region, Beaufort Sea, Arctic. Surprisingly
  during polar sunset in November and December, we found a high proportion of reads
  from both DNA and RNA belonging to another prasinophyte, Bathycoccus. We then analyzed
  a metagenome from a December sample and the resulting Bathycoccus metagenome assembled
  genome (MAG) covered ~90% of the Bathycoccus Ban7 reference genome. In contrast,
  only ~20% of a reference Micromonas genome was found in the metagenome. Our phylogenetic
  analysis of marker genes placed the Arctic Bathycoccus in the B1 coastal clade.
  In addition, substitution rates of 129 coding DNA sequences were ~1.6% divergent
  between the Arctic MAG and coastal Chilean upwelling MAGs and 17.3% between it and
  a South East Atlantic open ocean MAG in the B2 Clade. The metagenomic analysis also
  revealed a winter viral community highly skewed toward viruses targeting Micromonas,
  with a much lower diversity of viruses targeting Bathycoccus. Overall a combination
  of Micromonas being relatively less able to maintain activity under dark winter
  conditions and viral suppression of Micromonas may have contributed to the success
  of Bathycoccus in the Amundsen Gulf during winter.
