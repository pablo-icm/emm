abstract: "Abstract
The increasing demand for products for human consumption is leading to the fast-growing expansion of numerous food sectors such as marine aquaculture (mariculture). However, excessive input of nutrients and pollutants modifies marine ecosystems. Here, we applied a metagenomic approach to investigate these perturbations in samples from marine farms of gilthead seabream cultures. Results revealed dysbiosis and functional imbalance within the net cage with a unique structure, with little interference with samples from the fish microbiota or those collected far away from the coast. Remarkably, below the cage the prokaryotic community was highly similar to the marine microbiome of photic offshore samples. We recovered 48 novel metagenome-assembled genomes. Metagenomic recruitment revealed a significant change in the microbial community which was dominated by several Proteobacteria orders (Sphingomonadales, Pseudomonadales, Caudobacterales and Rhizobiales). Genomic potential for bioremediation processes, including nitrate removal through aerobic denitrification, and degradation of aromatic compounds and other toxic products were enriched in these microbes. The detrimental side effects were the increased number of antimicrobial resistance genes and the presence of potentially emergent pathogens. Knowledge of this metabolic diversity and the microbes involved in ecological balance recovery can be used to reduce the environmental impact of these practices."
