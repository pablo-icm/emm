abstract: Summary  We demonstrate here results showing that bottom‐up and top‐down
  control mechanisms can operate simultaneously and in concert in marine microbial
  food webs, controlling prokaryote diversity by a combination of viral lysis and
  substrate limitation. Models in microbial ecology predict that a shift in the type
  of bacterial growth rate limitation is expected to have a major effect on species
  composition within the community of bacterial hosts, with a subsequent shift in
  the composition of the viral community. Only moderate effects would, however, be
  expected in the absolute number of coexisting virus–host pairs. We investigated
  these relationships in nutrient‐manipulated systems, under simulated in situ conditions.
  There was a strong correlation in the clustering of the viral and bacterial community
  data supporting the existence of an important link between the bacterial and viral
  communities. As predicted, the total number of viral populations was the same in
  all treatments, while the composition of the viral community varied. Our results
  support the theoretical prediction that there is one control mechanism for the number
  of niches for coexisting virus–host pairs (top‐down control), and another mechanism
  that controls which virus–host pairs occupy these niches (bottom‐up control).
