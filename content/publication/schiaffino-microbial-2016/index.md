abstract: Summary Microbial eukaryotes play important roles in aquatic ecosystem functioning.
  Unravelling their distribution patterns and biogeography provides important baseline
  information to infer the underlying mechanisms that regulate the biodiversity and
  complexity of ecosystems. We studied the distribution patterns and factors driving
  diversity gradients in microeukaryote communities (total, abundant, uncommon and
  rare community composition) along a latitudinal gradient of lakes distributed from
  Argentinean Patagonia to Maritime Antarctica using both denaturing gradient gel
  electrophoresis (DGGE) and high‐throughput sequencing (Illumina HiSeq). DGGE and
  abundant Illumina operational taxonomic units (OTUs) showed both decreasing richness
  with latitude and significant differences between Patagonian and Antarctic lakes
  communities. In contrast, total richness did not change significantly across the
  latitudinal gradient, although evenness and diversity indices were significantly
  higher in Patagonian lakes. Beta‐diversity was characterized by a high species turnover,
  influenced by both environmental and geographical descriptors, although this pattern
  faded in the rare community. Our results suggest the co‐existence of a ‘core biosphere’
  containing reduced number of abundant/dominant OTUs on which classical ecological
  rules apply, together with a much larger seedbank of rare OTUs driven by stochastic
  and reduced dispersal processes. These findings shed new light on the biogeographical
  patterns and forces structuring inland microeukaryote composition across broad spatial
  scales.
