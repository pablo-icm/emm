abstract: Abstract  Background Isolation of marine microorganisms is fundamental to
  gather information about their physiology, ecology and genomic content. To date,
  most of the bacterial isolation efforts have focused on the photic ocean leaving
  the deep ocean less explored. We have created a marine culture collection of heterotrophic
  bacteria (MARINHET) using a standard marine medium comprising a total of 1561 bacterial
  strains, and covering a variety of oceanographic regions from different seasons
  and years, from 2009 to 2015. Specifically, our marine collection contains isolates
  from both photic (817) and aphotic layers (744), including the mesopelagic (362)
  and the bathypelagic (382), from the North Western Mediterranean Sea, the North
  and South Atlantic Ocean, the Indian, the Pacific, and the Arctic Oceans. We described
  the taxonomy, the phylogenetic diversity and the biogeography of a fraction of the
  marine culturable microorganisms to enhance our knowledge about which heterotrophic
  marine isolates are recurrently retrieved across oceans and along different depths.   Results  The
  partial sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene of all isolates revealed that they mainly
  affiliate with the classes Alphaproteobacteria (35.9%), Gammaproteobacteria (38.6%),
  and phylum Bacteroidetes (16.5%). In addition, Alteromonas and Erythrobacter genera
  were found the most common heterotrophic bacteria in the ocean growing in solid
  agar medium. When comparing all photic, mesopelagic, and bathypelagic isolates sequences
  retrieved from different stations, 37% of them were 100% identical. This percentage
  increased up to 59% when mesopelagic and bathypelagic strains were grouped as the
  aphotic dataset and compared to the photic dataset of isolates, indicating the ubiquity
  of some bacterial isolates along different ocean depths. Finally, we isolated three
  strains that represent a new species, and the genome comparison and phenotypic characterization
  of two of these strains (ISS653 and ISS1889) concluded that they belong to a new
  species within the genus Mesonia .    Conclusions Overall, this study highlights
  the relevance of culture-dependent studies, with focus on marine isolated bacteria
  from different oceanographic regions and depths, to provide a more comprehensive
  view of the culturable marine bacteria as part of the total marine microbial diversity.
