abstract: ABSTRACT  Isolation of microorganisms is a useful approach to gathering
  knowledge about their genomic properties, physiology, and ecology, in addition to
  allowing the characterization of novel taxa. We performed an extensive isolation
  effort on samples from seawater manipulation experiments that were carried out during
  the four astronomical seasons in a coastal site of the northwest Mediterranean to
  evaluate the impact of grazing, viral mortality, resource competition reduction,
  and light presence/absence on bacterioplankton growth. Isolates were retrieved using
  two growth media, and their full 16S rRNA gene was sequenced to assess their identity
  and calculate their culturability across seasons and experimental conditions. A
  total of 1,643 isolates were obtained, mainly affiliated to the classes Gammaproteobacteria
  (44%), Alphaproteobacteria (26%), and Bacteroidia (17%). Isolates pertaining to
  class Gammaproteobacteria were the most abundant in all experiments, while Bacteroidia
  were preferentially enriched in the treatments with reduced grazing. Sixty-one isolates
  had a similarity below 97% to cultured taxa and are thus putatively novel. Comparison
  of isolate sequences with 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequences from the same samples
  showed that the percentage of reads corresponding to isolates was 21.4% within the
  whole data set, with dramatic increases in the summer virus-reduced (71%) and diluted
  (47%) treatments. In fact, we were able to isolate the top 10 abundant taxa in several
  experiments and from the whole data set. We also show that top-down and bottom-up
  controls differentially affect taxa in terms of culturability. Our results indicate
  that culturing marine bacteria using agar plates can be successful in certain ecological
  situations.   IMPORTANCE Bottom-up and top-down controls greatly influence marine
  microbial community composition and dynamics, which in turn have effects on their
  culturability. We isolated a high amount of heterotrophic bacterial strains from
  experiments where seawater environmental conditions had been manipulated and found
  that decreasing grazing and viral pressure as well as rising nutrient availability
  are key factors increasing the success in culturing marine bacteria. Our data hint
  at factors influencing culturability and underpin bacterial cultures as a powerful
  way to discover new taxa.  ,  Bottom-up and top-down controls greatly influence
