abstract: 'Summary Phytoplankton and heterotrophic prokaryotes are major components
  of the microbial food web and interact continuously: heterotrophic prokaryotes utilize
  the dissolved organic carbon derived from phytoplankton exudation or cell lysis
  (DOCp), and mineralization by heterotrophic prokaryotes provides inorganic nutrients
  for phytoplankton. For this reason, these communities are expected to be closely
  linked, although the study of the interactions between them is still a major challenge.
  Recent studies have presented interactions between phytoplankton and heterotrophic
  prokaryotes based on coexistence or covariation throughout a time‐series. However,
  a real quantification of the carbon flow within these networks (defined as the interaction
  strength, IS) has not been achieved yet. This is critical to understand the selectivity
  degree of bacteria responding to specific algal DOCp. Here we used microautoradiography
  to quantify the preferences of the major heterotrophic prokaryote phylogenetic groups
  on DOC derived from several representative phytoplankton species, and expressed
  these preferences as an IS value. The distribution of the ISs was not random but
  rather skewed towards weak interactions, in a similar way as the distributions described
  for stable complex non‐microbial ecosystems, indicating that there are some cases
  of high specificity on the use of specific algal DOCp by some bacterial groups,
  but weak interactions are more common and may be relevant as well. The variety of
  IS patterns observed supports the view that the vast range of different resources
  (different types of organic molecules) available in the sea selects and maintains
  the high levels of diversity described for marine bacterioplankton.'
