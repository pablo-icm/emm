abstract: "BACKGROUND: COVID-19 presents a spectrum of signs and symptoms in pregnant
  women that might resemble preeclampsia. Differentiation between severe COVID-19
  and preeclampsia is difficult in some cases. OBJECTIVE: To study biomarkers of endothelial
  damage, coagulation, innate immune response, and angiogenesis in preeclampsia and
  COVID-19 in pregnancy in addition to in vitro alterations in endothelial cells exposed
  to sera from pregnant women with preeclampsia and COVID-19. STUDY DESIGN: Plasma
  and sera samples were obtained from pregnant women with COVID-19 infection classified
  into mild (n=10) or severe (n=9) and from women with normotensive pregnancies as
  controls (n=10) and patients with preeclampsia (n=13). A panel of plasmatic biomarkers
  was assessed, including vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, soluble tumor necrosis
  factor-receptor I, heparan sulfate, von Willebrand factor antigen (activity and
  multimeric pattern), α2-antiplasmin, C5b9, neutrophil extracellular traps, placental
  growth factor, soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1, and angiopoietin 2. In addition,
  microvascular endothelial cells were exposed to patients' sera, and changes in the
  cell expression of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 on cell membranes and von Willebrand
  factor release to the extracellular matrix were evaluated through immunofluorescence.
  Changes in inflammation cell signaling pathways were also assessed by of p38 mitogen-activated
  protein kinase phosphorylation. Statistical analysis included univariate and multivariate
  methods. RESULTS: Biomarker profiles of patients with mild COVID-19 were similar
  to those of controls. Both preeclampsia and severe COVID-19 showed significant alterations
  in most circulating biomarkers with distinctive profiles. Whereas severe COVID-19
  exhibited higher concentrations of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, soluble tumor
  necrosis factor-α receptor I, heparan sulfate, von Willebrand factor antigen, and
  neutrophil extracellular traps, with a significant reduction of placental growth
  factor compared with controls, preeclampsia presented a marked increase in vascular
  cell adhesion molecule-1 and soluble tumor necrosis factor-α receptor I (significantly
  increased compared with controls and patients with severe COVID-19), with a striking
  reduction in von Willebrand factor antigen, von Willebrand factor activity, and
  α2-antiplasmin. As expected, reduced placental growth factor, increased soluble
  fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 and angiopoietin 2, and a very high soluble fms-like
  tyrosine kinase-1 to placental growth factor ratio were also observed in preeclampsia.
  In addition, a significant increase in C5b9 and neutrophil extracellular traps was
  also detected in preeclampsia compared with controls. Principal component analysis
  demonstrated a clear separation between patients with preeclampsia and the other
  groups (first and second components explained 42.2% and 13.5% of the variance),
  mainly differentiated by variables related to von Willebrand factor, soluble tumor
  necrosis factor-receptor I, heparan sulfate, and soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1.
  Von Willebrand factor multimeric analysis revealed the absence of von Willebrand
  factor high-molecular-weight multimers in preeclampsia (similar profile to von Willebrand
  disease type 2A), whereas in healthy pregnancies and COVID-19 patients, von Willebrand
  factor multimeric pattern was normal. Sera from both preeclampsia and severe COVID-19
  patients induced an overexpression of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 and von
  Willebrand factor in endothelial cells in culture compared with controls. However,
  the effect of preeclampsia was less pronounced than the that of severe COVID-19.
  Immunoblots of lysates from endothelial cells exposed to mild and severe COVID-19
  and preeclampsia sera showed an increase in p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase
  phosphorylation. Patients with severe COVID-19 and preeclampsia were statistically
  different from controls, suggesting that both severe COVID-19 and preeclampsia sera
  can activate inflammatory signaling pathways. CONCLUSION: Although similar in in vitro
  endothelial dysfunction, preeclampsia and severe COVID-19 exhibit distinctive profiles
  of circulating biomarkers related to endothelial damage, coagulopathy, and angiogenic
  imbalance that could aid in the differential diagnosis of these entities."
