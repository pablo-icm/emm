abstract: 'Abstract Microbial eukaryotes are key components of the ocean plankton.
  Yet, our understanding of their community composition and activity in different
  water layers of the ocean is limited, particularly for picoeukaryotes (0.2–3 µm
  cell size). Here, we examined the picoeukaryotic communities inhabiting different
  vertical zones of the tropical and subtropical global ocean: surface, deep chlorophyll
  maximum, mesopelagic (including the deep scattering layer and oxygen minimum zones),
  and bathypelagic. Communities were analysed by high-tthroughput sequencing of the
  18S rRNA gene (V4 region) as represented by DNA (community structure) and RNA (metabolism),
  followed by delineation of Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) at 99% similarity.
  We found a stratification of the picoeukaryotic communities along the water column,
  with assemblages corresponding to the sunlit and dark ocean. Specific taxonomic
  groups either increased (e.g., Chrysophyceae or Bicosoecida) or decreased (e.g.,
  Dinoflagellata or MAST-3) in abundance with depth. We used the rRNA:rDNA ratio of
  each OTU as a proxy of metabolic activity. The highest relative activity was found
  in the mesopelagic layer for most taxonomic groups, and the lowest in the bathypelagic.
  Altogether, we characterize the change in community structure and metabolic activity
  of picoeukaryotes with depth in the global ocean, suggesting a hotspot of activity
  in the mesopelagic.'
