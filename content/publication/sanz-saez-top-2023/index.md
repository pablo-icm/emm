abstract: Traditional culture techniques usually retrieve a small fraction of the
  marine microbial diversity, which mainly belong to the so-called rare biosphere.
  However, this paradigm has not been fully tested at a broad scale, especially in
  the deep ocean. Here, we examined the fraction of heterotrophic bacterial communities
  in photic and deep ocean layers that could be recovered by culture-dependent techniques
  at a large scale. We compared 16S rRNA gene sequences from a collection of 2003
  cultured heterotrophic marine bacteria with global 16S rRNA metabarcoding datasets
  (16S TAGs) covering surface, mesopelagic and bathypelagic ocean samples that included
  16 of the 23 samples used for isolation. These global datasets represent 60 322
  unique 16S amplicon sequence variants (ASVs). Our results reveal a significantly
  higher proportion of isolates identical to ASVs in deeper ocean layers reaching
  up to 28% of the 16S TAGs of the bathypelagic microbial communities, which included
  the isolation of 3 of the top 10 most abundant 16S ASVs in the global bathypelagic
  ocean, related to the genera Sulfitobacter, Halomonas and Erythrobacter. These isolates
  contributed differently to the prokaryotic communities across different plankton
  size fractions, recruiting between 38% in the free-living fraction (0.2–0.8 µm)
  and up to 45% in the largest particles (20–200 µm) in the bathypelagic ocean. Our
  findings support the hypothesis that sinking particles in the bathypelagic act as
  resource-rich habitats, suitable for the growth of heterotrophic bacteria with a
  copiotroph lifestyle that can be cultured, and that these cultivable bacteria can
  also thrive as free-living bacteria.
