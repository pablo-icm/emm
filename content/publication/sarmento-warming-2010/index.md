abstract: Previsions of a warmer ocean as a consequence of climatic change point to
  a 2–6°C temperature rise during this century in surface oceanic waters. Heterotrophic
  bacteria occupy the central position of the marine microbial food web, and their
  metabolic activity and interactions with other compartments within the web are regulated
  by temperature. In particular, key ecosystem processes like bacterial production
  (BP), respiration (BR), growth efficiency and bacterial–grazer trophic interactions
  are likely to change in a warmer ocean. Different approaches can be used to predict
  these changes. Here we combine evidence of the effects of temperature on these processes
  and interactions coming from laboratory experiments, space-for-time substitutions,
  long-term data from microbial observatories and theoretical predictions. Some of
  the evidence we gathered shows opposite trends to warming depending on the spatio-temporal
  scale of observation, and the complexity of the system under study. In particular,
  we show that warming (i) increases BR, (ii) increases bacterial losses to their
  grazers, and thus bacterial–grazer biomass flux within the microbial food web, (iii)
  increases BP if enough resources are available (as labile organic matter derived
  from phytoplankton excretion or lysis), and (iv) increases bacterial losses to grazing
  at lower rates than BP, and hence decreasing the proportion of production removed
  by grazers. As a consequence, bacterial abundance would also increase and reinforce
  the already dominant role of microbes in the carbon cycle of a warmer ocean.
