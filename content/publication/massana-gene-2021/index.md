abstract: Abstract Phagocytosis is a fundamental process in marine ecosystems by which
  prey organisms are consumed and their biomass incorporated in food webs or remineralized.
  However, studies searching for the genes underlying this key ecological process
  in free-living phagocytizing protists are still scarce, in part due to the lack
  of appropriate ecological models. Our reanalysis of recent molecular datasets revealed
  that the cultured heterotrophic flagellate Cafeteria burkhardae is widespread in
  the global oceans, which prompted us to design a transcriptomics study with this
  species, grown with the cultured flavobacterium Dokdonia sp. We compared the gene
  expression between exponential and stationary phases, which were complemented with
  three starvation by dilution phases that appeared as intermediate states. We found
  distinct expression profiles in each condition and identified 2056 differentially
  expressed genes between exponential and stationary samples. Upregulated genes at
  the exponential phase were related to DNA duplication, transcription and translational
  machinery, protein remodeling, respiration and phagocytosis, whereas upregulated
  genes in the stationary phase were involved in signal transduction, cell adhesion,
  and lipid metabolism. We identified a few highly expressed phagocytosis genes, like
  peptidases and proton pumps, which could be used to target this ecologically relevant
  process in marine ecosystems.
