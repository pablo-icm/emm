abstract: Summary  Marine cyanobacteria of the genera Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus
  are important contributors to global primary production occupying a key position
  at the base of marine food webs. The genetically diverse nature of each genus is
  likely an important reason for their successful colonization of vast tracts of the
  world's oceans, a feature that has led to detailed analysis of the distribution
  of these genetic lineages at the local and ocean basin scale. Here, we extend these
  analyses to the global dimension, using new data from cruises in the Pacific, Indian
  and Arctic Oceans in combination with data from previous studies in the Atlantic
  Ocean, Arabian Sea, Red Sea and a circumnavigation of the southern hemisphere to
  form a data set which comprises most of the world's major ocean systems. We show
  that the distribution patterns of Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus lineages are
  remarkably similar in different ocean systems with comparable environmental conditions,
  but producing a strikingly different ‘signature’ in the four major ocean domains
  or biomes (the Polar Domain, Coastal Boundary Domain, Trade Winds Domain and Westerly
  Winds Domain). This clearly reiterates the idea of spatial partitioning of individual
  cyanobacterial lineages, but at the global scale.
