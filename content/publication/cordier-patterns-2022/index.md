abstract: Remote deep-ocean sediment (DOS) ecosystems are among the least explored
  biomes on Earth. Genomic assessments of their biodiversity have failed to separate
  indigenous benthic organisms from sinking plankton. Here, we compare global-scale
  eukaryotic DNA metabarcoding datasets (18 S -V9) from abyssal and lower bathyal
  surficial sediments and euphotic and aphotic ocean pelagic layers to distinguish
  plankton from benthic diversity in sediment material. Based on 1685 samples collected
  throughout the world ocean, we show that DOS diversity is at least threefold that
  in pelagic realms, with nearly two-thirds represented by abundant yet unknown eukaryotes.
  These benthic communities are spatially structured by ocean basins and particulate
  organic carbon (POC) flux from the upper ocean. Plankton DNA reaching the DOS originates
  from abundant species, with maximal deposition at high latitudes. Its seafloor DNA
  signature predicts variations in POC export from the surface and reveals previously
  overlooked taxa that may drive the biological carbon pump.  ,  A global analysis
  of surface to seafloor eukaryotes distinguishes benthic diversity from sinking plankton
  in deep-sea sediments.
