abstract: Abstract The assimilation of organic nutrients by autotrophs, a form of
  mixotrophy, has been demonstrated in the globally abundant marine picocyanobacterial
  genera Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus. However, the range of compounds used and
  the distribution of organic compound uptake genes within picocyanobacteria are unknown.
  Here we analyze genomic and metagenomic data from around the world to determine
  the extent and distribution of mixotrophy in these phototrophs. Analysis of 49 Prochlorococcus
  and 18 Synechococcus isolate genomes reveals that all have the transporters necessary
  to take up amino acids, peptides and sugars. However, the number and type of transporters
  and associated catabolic genes differ between different phylogenetic groups, with
  low-light IV Prochlorococcus, and 5.1B, 5.2 and 5.3 Synechococcus strains having
  the largest number. Metagenomic data from 68 stations from the Tara Oceans expedition
  indicate that the genetic potential for mixotrophy in picocyanobacteria is globally
  distributed and differs between clades. Phylogenetic analyses indicate gradual organic
  nutrient transporter gene loss from the low-light IV to the high-light II Prochlorococcus.
  The phylogenetic differences in genetic capacity for mixotrophy, combined with the
  ubiquity of picocyanobacterial organic compound uptake genes suggests that mixotrophy
  has a more central role in picocyanobacterial ecology than was previously thought.
