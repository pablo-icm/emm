abstract: Abstract Heterotrophic lineages of stramenopiles exhibit enormous diversity
  in morphology, lifestyle, and habitat. Among them, the marine stramenopiles (MASTs)
  represent numerous independent lineages that are only known from environmental sequences
  retrieved from marine samples. The core energy metabolism characterizing these unicellular
  eukaryotes is poorly understood. Here, we used single-cell genomics to retrieve,
  annotate, and compare the genomes of 15 MAST species, obtained by coassembling sequences
  from 140 individual cells sampled from the marine surface plankton. Functional annotations
  from their gene repertoires are compatible with all of them being phagocytotic.
  The unique presence of rhodopsin genes in MAST species, together with their widespread
  expression in oceanic waters, supports the idea that MASTs may be capable of using
  sunlight to thrive in the photic ocean. Additional subsets of genes used in phagocytosis,
  such as proton pumps for vacuole acidification and peptidases for prey digestion,
  did not reveal particular trends in MAST genomes as compared with nonphagocytotic
  stramenopiles, except a larger presence and diversity of V-PPase genes. Our analysis
  reflects the complexity of phagocytosis machinery in microbial eukaryotes, which
  contrasts with the well-defined set of genes for photosynthesis. These new genomic
  data provide the essential framework to study ecophysiology of uncultured species
  and to gain better understanding of the function of rhodopsins and related carotenoids
  in stramenopiles.
