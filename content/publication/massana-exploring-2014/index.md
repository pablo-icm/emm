abstract: Abstract Molecular surveys in planktonic marine systems have unveiled a
  large novel diversity of small protists. A large part of this diversity belongs
  to basal heterotrophic stramenopiles and is distributed in a set of polyphyletic
  ribogroups (described from rDNA sequences) collectively named as MAST (MArine STramenopiles).
  In the few groups investigated, MAST cells are globally distributed and abundant
  bacterial grazers, therefore having a putatively large impact on marine ecosystem
  functioning. The main aim of this study is to reevaluate the MAST ribogroups described
  so far and to determine whether additional groups can be found. For this purpose,
  we used traditional and state-of-the-art molecular tools, combining 18S rDNA sequences
  from publicly available clone libraries, single amplified genomes (SAGs) of planktonic
  protists, and a pyrosequencing survey from coastal waters and sediments. Our analysis
  indicated a final set of 18 MAST groups plus 5 new ribogroups within Ochrophyta
  (named as MOCH). The MAST ribogroups were then analyzed in more detail. Seven were
  typical of anoxic systems and one of oxic sediments. The rest were clearly members
  of oxic marine picoplankton. We characterized the genetic diversity within each
  MAST group and defined subclades for the more diverse (46 subclades in 8 groups).
  The analyses of sequences within subclades revealed further ecological specializations.
  Our data provide a renovated framework for phylogenetic classification of the numerous
  MAST ribogroups and support the notion of a tight link between phylogeny and ecological
  distribution. These diverse and largely uncultured protists are widespread and ecologically
  relevant members of marine microbial assemblages.
