abstract: Summary  Most marine sponges establish a persistent association with a wide
  array of phylogenetically and physiologically diverse microbes. To date, the role
  of these symbiotic microbial communities in the metabolism and nutrient cycles of
  the sponge‐microbe consortium remains largely unknown. We identified and quantified
  the microbial communities associated with three common Mediterranean sponge species,
  Dysidea avara , Agelas oroides and Chondrosia reniformis ( Demospongiae ) that cohabitate
  coralligenous community. For each sponge we quantified the uptake and release of
  dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and nitrogen (DON), inorganic nitrogen and phosphate.
  Low microbial abundance and no evidence for DOC uptake or nitrification were found
  for D. avara . In contrast A. oroides and C. reniformis showed high microbial abundance
  (30% and 70% of their tissue occupied by microbes respectively) and both species
  exhibited high nitrification and high DOC and NH 4 + uptake. Surprisingly, these
  unique metabolic pathways were mediated in each sponge species by a different, and
  host specific, microbial community. The functional convergence of microbial consortia
  found in these two sympatric sponge species, suggest that these metabolic processes
  may be of special relevance to the success of the holobiont.
