abstract: "This study aimed to improve the understanding of the nutrient modulation of Ostreopsis cf. ovata toxin content. During the 2018 natural bloom in the NW Mediterranean, the total toxin content (up to ca. 57.6 ± 7.0 pg toxin cell−1) varied markedly. The highest values often coincided with elevated O. cf. ovata cell abundance and with low inorganic nutrient concentrations. The first culture experiment with a strain isolated from that bloom showed that cell toxin content was higher in the stationary than in the exponential phase of the cultures; phosphate- and nitrate-deficient cells exhibited similar cell toxin variability patterns. The second experiment with different conditions of nitrogen concentration and source (nitrate, urea, ammonium, and fertilizer) presented the highest cellular toxin content in the high-nitrogen cultures; among these, urea induced a significantly lower cellular toxin content than the other nutrient sources. Under both high- and low-nitrogen concentrations, cell toxin content was also higher in the stationary than in the exponential phase. The toxin profile of the field and cultured cells included ovatoxin (OVTX) analogues -a to -g and isobaric PLTX (isoPLTX). OVTX-a and -b were dominant while OVTX-f, -g, and isoPLTX contributed less than 1-2%. Overall, the data suggest that although nutrients determine the intensity of the O. cf. ovata bloom, the relationship of major nutrient concentrations, sources and stoichiometry with cellular toxin production is not straightforward."
