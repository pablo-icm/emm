abstract: On a standard oceanographic cruise, flow cytometry data are usually collected
  sparsely through a bottle-based sampling and with stations separated by kilometers
  leading to a fragmented view of the ecosystem; to improve the resolution of the
  datasets produced by this technique here it is proposed the application of an automatic
  method of sampling and staining. The system used consists of a flow-cytometer (Accuri-C6)
  connected to an automated continuous sampler (OC-300) that collects samples of marine
  surface waters every 15 min. We tested this system for five days during a brief
  Mediterranean cruise with the aim of estimating the abundance, relative size and
  phenotypic diversity of prokaryotes. Seawater was taken by a faucet linked to an
  inlet pump ( ca. 5 m depth). Once the sample was taken, the Oncyt-300 stained it
  and sent it to the flow cytometer. A total of 366 samples were collected, effectively
  achieving a fine-grained scale view of microbial community composition both through
  space and time. A significative positive relationship was found comparing data obtained
  with the automatic method and 10 samples collected from the faucet but processed
  with the standard protocol. Abundance values retrieved varied from 3.56·10 5 cell
  mL −1 in the coastal area till 6.87 10 5 cell mL −1 in open waters, exceptional
  values were reached in the harbor area where abundances peaked to 1.28 10 6 cell
  mL −1 . The measured features (abundance and size) were associated with metadata
  (temperature, salinity, conductivity) also taken in continuous, of which conductivity
  was the one that better explained the variability of abundance. A full 24 h measurement
  cycle was performed resulting in slightly higher median bacterial abundances values
  during daylight hours compared to night. Alpha diversity, calculated using computational
  cytometry techniques, showed a higher value in the coastal area above 41° of latitude
  and had a strong inverse relationship with both salinity and conductivity. This
  is the first time to our knowledge that the OC-300 is directly applied to the marine
  environment during an oceanographic cruise; due to its high-resolution, this set-up
  shows great potential both to cover large sampling areas, and to monitor day-night
  cycles in situ .
