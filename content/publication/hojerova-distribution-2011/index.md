abstract: Summary  The distribution of aerobic anoxygenic phototrophs (AAPs) was surveyed
  in various regions of the Mediterranean Sea in spring and summer. These phototrophic
  bacteria were present within the euphotic layer at all sampled stations. The AAP
  abundances increased with increasing trophic status ranging from 2.5 × 10 3 cells
  per ml in oligotrophic Eastern Mediterranean up to 90 × 10 3 cells per ml in the
  Bay of Villefranche. Aerobic anoxygenic phototrophs made up on average 1–4% of total
  prokaryotes in low nutrient areas, whereas in coastal and more productive stations
  these organisms represented 3–11% of total prokaryotes. Diel bacteriochlorophyll
  a decay measurements showed that AAP community in the Western Mediterranean grew
  rapidly, at rates from 1.13 to 1.42 day −1 . The lower AAP abundances registered
  in the most oligotrophic waters suggest that they are relatively poor competitors
  under nutrient limiting conditions. Instead, AAPs appear to be metabolically active
  organisms, which thrive better in more eutrophic environments providing the necessary
  substrates to maintain high growth rates.
