            Marine Stramenopiles (MAST) were first described two decades ago through ribosomal RNA gene (rRNA gene) sequences from marine surveys of microbial eukaryotes. MAST comprise several independent lineages at the base of the Stramenopiles. Despite their prevalence in the ocean, the majority of MAST diversity remains uncultured. Previous studies, mainly in marine environments, have explored MAST's cell morphology, distribution, trophic strategies, and genomics using culturing-independent methods. In comparison, less is known about their presence outside marine habitats. Here, we analyze the extensive EukBank dataset to assess the extent to which MAST can be considered marine protists. Additionally, by incorporating newly available rRNA gene sequences, we update Stramenopiles phylogeny, identifying three novel MAST lineages. Our results indicate that MAST are primarily marine with notable exceptions within MAST-2 and MAST-12, where certain subclades are prevalent in freshwater and soil habitats. In the marine water column, only a few MAST species, particularly within clades -1, -3, -4 and -7, dominate and exhibit clear latitudinal distribution patterns. Overall, the massive sequencing dataset analyzed in our study confirms and partially expands the previously described diversity of MASTs groups and underscores the predominantly marine nature of most of these uncultured lineages.},

              Understanding the patterns of marine microbial diversity (Bacteria + Archaea) is essential, as variations in their alpha‐ and beta‐diversities can affect ecological processes. Investigations of microbial diversity from global oceanographic expeditions and basin‐wide transects show positive correlations between microbial diversity and either temperature or productivity, but these studies rarely captured seasonality, especially in polar regions. Here, using multiannual alpha‐diversity data from eight time series in the northern and southern hemispheres, we show that marine microbial community richness and evenness generally correlate more strongly with daylength than with temperature or chlorophyll

Arthropods had the greatest taxonomic richness of metazoan phyla at the surface, while cnidarians had the greatest richness in pelagic zones. Half of the marine metazoan eDNA from metagenome datasets was from arthropods, followed by cnidarians and nematodes. We found that mean surface temperature and primary productivity were positively related to metazoan taxonomic richness. Our findings concur with existing knowledge that temperature and primary productivity are important drivers of taxonomic richness for specific taxa at the ocean’s surface, but these correlations are less evident in the deep ocean.

            Marine microbial communities differ genetically, metabolically, and ecologically according to their lifestyle, and they may respond differently to environmental changes. In this study, we investigated the seasonal dynamics of bacterial assemblies in the free‐living (FL) and particle‐associated (PA) fractions across a span of 6 years in the Blanes Bay Microbial Observatory in the Northwestern Mediterranean. Both lifestyles showed marked seasonality. The trends in alpha diversity were similar, with lower values in spring–summer than in autumn‐winter. Samples from both fractions were grouped seasonally and the percentage of community variability explained by the measured environmental variables was comparable (32\% in FL and 31\% in PA). Canonical analyses showed that biotic interactions were determinants of bacterioplankton dynamics and that their relevance varies depending on lifestyles. Time‐decay curves confirmed a high degree of predictability in both fractions. Yet, ‘seasonal’ Amplicon Sequence Variants (ASVs) (as defined by Lomb Scargle time series analysis) in the PA communities represented 46\% of the total relative abundance while these accounted for 30\% in the FL fraction. These results demonstrate that bacteria inhabiting both fractions exhibit marked seasonality, highlighting the importance of accounting for both lifestyles to fully comprehend the dynamics of marine prokaryotic communities.},

              A plant parasite associated with the white haze disease in apples, the Basidiomycota
              Gjaerumia minor,
              has been found in most samples of the global bathypelagic ocean. An analysis of environmental 18S rDNA sequences on 12 vertical profiles of the Malaspina 2010 expedition shows that the relative abundance of this cultured species increases with depth while its distribution is remarkably different between the deep waters of the Pacific and Atlantic oceans, being present in higher concentrations in the former. This is evident from sequence analysis and a microscopic survey with a species-specific newly designed TSA-FISH probe. Several hints point to the hypothesis that
              G. minor
              is transported to the deep ocean attached to particles, and the absence of
              G. minor
              in bathypelagic Atlantic waters could then be explained by the absence of this organism in surface waters of the equatorial Atlantic. The good correlation of

            A persistent microbial seed bank is postulated to sustain the marine biosphere, and recent findings show that prokaryotic taxa present in the ocean’s surface dominate prokaryotic communities throughout the water column. Yet, environmental conditions exert a tight control on the activity of prokaryotes, and drastic changes in these conditions are known to occur from the surface to deep waters. The simultaneous characterization of the total (DNA) and active (i.e. with potential for protein synthesis, RNA) free-living communities in 13 stations distributed across the tropical and subtropical global ocean allowed us to assess their change in structure and diversity along the water column. We observed that active communities were surprisingly more similar along the vertical gradient than total communities. Looking at the vertical connectivity of the active vs. the total communities, we found that taxa detected in the surface sometimes accounted for more than 75\% of the active microbiome of bathypelagic waters (50\% on average). These active taxa were generally rare in the surface, representing a small fraction of all the surface taxa. Our findings show that the drastic vertical change in environmental conditions leads to the inactivation and disappearance of a large proportion of surface taxa, but some surface-rare taxa remain active (or with potential for protein synthesis) and dominate the bathypelagic active microbiome.},

            The osmotrophic uptake of dissolved organic compounds in the ocean is considered to be dominated by heterotrophic prokaryotes, whereas the role of planktonic eukaryotes is still unclear. We explored the capacity of natural eukaryotic plankton communities to incorporate the synthetic amino acid L-homopropargylglycine (HPG, analogue of methionine) using biorthogonal noncanonical amino acid tagging (BONCAT), and we compared it with prokaryotic HPG use throughout a 9-day survey in the NW Mediterranean. BONCAT allows to fluorescently identify translationally active cells, but it has never been applied to natural eukaryotic communities. We found a large diversity of photosynthetic and heterotrophic eukaryotes incorporating HPG into proteins, with dinoflagellates and diatoms showing the highest percentages of BONCAT-labelled cells (49 ± 25\% and 52 ± 15\%, respectively). Among them, pennate diatoms exhibited higher HPG incorporation in the afternoon than in the morning, whereas small (≤5 μm) photosynthetic eukaryotes and heterotrophic nanoeukaryotes showed the opposite pattern. Centric diatoms (e.g. Chaetoceros, Thalassiosira, and Lauderia spp.) dominated the eukaryotic HPG incorporation due to their high abundances and large sizes, accounting for up to 86\% of the eukaryotic BONCAT signal and strongly correlating with bulk 3H-leucine uptake rates. When including prokaryotes, eukaryotes were estimated to account for 19–31\% of the bulk BONCAT signal. Our results evidence a large complexity in the osmotrophic uptake of HPG, which varies over time within and across eukaryotic groups and highlights the potential of BONCAT to quantify osmotrophy and protein synthesis in complex eukaryotic communities.},

              Paramuricea clavata
              is an ecosystem architect of the Mediterranean temperate reefs that is currently threatened by episodic mass mortality events related to global warming. The microbiome may play an active role in the thermal stress susceptibility of corals, potentially holding the answer as to why corals show differential sensitivity to heat stress. To investigate this, the prokaryotic and eukaryotic microbiome of
              P. clavata
              collected from around the Mediterranean was characterised before experimental heat stress to determine if its microbial composition influences the thermal response of the holobiont. We found that members of

              Dino‐Group I Clade 1

              P. clavata
              mortality following heat stress may be caused by a shift from apparent commensalism to parasitism in the corallicolid‐coral host relationship driven by the added stress.

A few potential interactions were global, meaning they occurred across regions at the same depth, while 11-36\% were regional within specific depths. The bathypelagic zone had the lowest proportion of global associations, and regional associations increased with depth.

            Perkinsea constitutes a lineage within the Alveolata eukaryotic superphylum, mainly composed of parasitic organisms. Some described species represent significant ecological and economic threats due to their invasive ability and pathogenicity, which can lead to mortality events. However, the genetic diversity of these described species is just the tip of the iceberg. Environmental surveys targeting this lineage are still scarce and mainly limited to the Northern Hemisphere. Here, we aim to conduct an in depth exploration of the Perkinsea group, uncovering the diversity across a variety of environments, including those beyond freshwater and marine ecosystems. We seek to identify and describe putative novel organisms based on their genetic signatures. In this study, we conducted an extensive analysis of a metabarcoding dataset, focusing on the V4 region of the 18S rRNA gene (the EukBank dataset), to investigate the diversity, distribution and environmental preferences of the Perkinsea. Our results reveal a remarkable diversity within the Perkinsea, with 1568 Amplicon Sequence Variants (ASVs) identified across thousands of environmental samples. Surprisingly, we showed a substantial diversity of Perkinsea within soil samples (269 ASVs), challenging the previous assumption that this group is confined to marine and freshwater environments. In addition, we revealed that a notable proportion of Perkinsea ASVs (428 ASVs) could correspond to putative new organisms, encompassing the well-established taxonomic group Perkinsidae. Finally, our study shed light on previously unveiled taxonomic groups, including the Xcellidae, and revealed their environmental distribution. These findings demonstrate that Perkinsea exhibits far greater diversity than previously detected and surprisingly extends beyond marine and freshwater environments. The meta-analysis conducted in this study has unveiled the existence of previously unknown clusters within the Perkinsea lineage, solely identified based on their genetic signatures. Considering the ecological and economic importance of described Perkinsea species, these results suggest that Perkinsea may play a significant, yet previously unrecognized, role across a wide range of environments, spanning from soil environments to the abyssal zone of the open ocean with important implications for ecosystem functioning.},

We investigate the ecological processes (selection, dispersal, and drift) structuring global-ocean picoplanktonic communities inhabiting the epipelagic (0 to 200 meters), mesopelagic (200 to 1000 meters), and bathypelagic (1000 to 4000 meters) zones. We found that selection decreased, while dispersal limitation increased with depth, possibly due to differences in habitat heterogeneity and dispersal barriers such as water masses and bottom topography. Picoplankton β-diversity positively correlated with environmental heterogeneity and water mass variability, but this relationship tended to be weaker for eukaryotes than for prokaryotes. Community patterns were more pronounced in the Mediterranean Sea, probably because of its cross-basin environmental heterogeneity and deep-water isolation. We conclude that different combinations of ecological mechanisms shape the biogeography of the ocean microbiome across depths.

              Background
              Marine heterotrophic flagellates (HF) are dominant bacterivores in the ocean, where they represent the trophic link between bacteria and higher trophic levels and participate in the recycling of inorganic nutrients for regenerated primary production. Studying their activity and function in the ecosystem is challenging since most of the HFs in the ocean are still uncultured. In the present work, we investigated gene expression of natural HF communities during bacterivory in four unamended seawater incubations.
            
            
              Results
              The most abundant species growing in our incubations belonged to the taxonomic groups MAST-4, MAST-7, Chrysophyceae, and Telonemia. Gene expression dynamics were similar between incubations and could be divided into three states based on microbial counts, each state displaying distinct expression patterns. The analysis of samples where HF growth was highest revealed some highly expressed genes that could be related to bacterivory. Using available genomic and transcriptomic references, we identified 25 species growing in our incubations and used those to compare the expression levels of these specific genes.
            
            
              Conclusions
              Our results indicate that several peptidases, together with some glycoside hydrolases and glycosyltransferases, are more expressed in phagotrophic than in phototrophic species, and thus could be used to infer the process of bacterivory in natural assemblages.},

            East African Great Lakes are old and unique natural resources heavily utilized by their bordering countries. In those lakes, ecosystem functioning is dominated by pelagic processes, where microorganisms are key components; however, protistan diversity is barely known. We investigated the community composition of small eukaryotes (\&lt;10 µm) in surface waters of four African Lakes (Kivu, Edward, Albert and Victoria) by sequencing the 18S rRNA gene. Moreover, in the meromictic Lake Kivu, two stations were vertically studied. We found high protistan diversity distributed in 779 operational taxonomic units (OTUs), spanning in 11 high-rank lineages, being Alveolata (31\%), Opisthokonta (20\%) and Stramenopiles (17\%) the most represented supergroups. Surface protistan assemblages were associated with conductivity and productivity gradients, whereas depth had a strong effect on protistan community in Kivu, with higher contribution of heterotrophic organisms. Approximately 40\% of OTUs had low similarity (\&lt;90\%) with reported sequences in public databases; these were mostly coming from deep anoxic waters of Kivu, suggesting a high extent of novel diversity. We also detected several taxa so far considered exclusive of marine ecosystems. Our results unveiled a complex and largely undescribed protistan community, in which several lineages have adapted to different niches after crossing the salinity boundary.},

Here we analyze 58 metagenomes from tropical and subtropical deep oceans to generate the Malaspina Gene Database. Free-living or particle-attached lifestyles drive functional differences in bathypelagic prokaryotic communities, regardless of their biogeography.

The widespread potential to grow both autotrophically and heterotrophically suggests that mixotrophy is an ecologically relevant trait in the deep ocean.

            Ciliates are globally distributed eukaryotic organisms inhabiting virtually all environments on Earth. Although ciliates range from 10 µm to a few millimetres in cell size, they are repeatedly reported in the pico‐sized fraction ({\textless}2–3 µm) of molecular surveys. Here, we used existing data sets (BioMarKs and Tara Oceans) with different size fractions to demonstrate that the ciliate pico‐sized signal, probably derived from cell breakage during filtration, is informative and reliable to study marine ciliate biodiversity and biogeography. We then used sequences from the pico‐eukaryotic fraction of two circumnavigation expeditions, Malaspina‐2010 and Tara Oceans, to give insights into the taxonomic composition and horizontal and vertical distribution of ciliates in the global ocean. The results suggested a high homogeneity of ciliate communities along the ocean surface from temperate to tropical waters, with ciliate assemblages dominated by a few abundant and widely distributed taxa. Very few taxa were found in a single oceanic region, therefore suggesting a high level of ciliate cosmopolitanism in the global ocean. In vertical profiles, ciliates were detected up to 4,000 m depth, and a clear vertical community structuring was observed. Our results provided evidence supporting ciliates as deeply integrated organisms in the deep‐sea trophic web, where they may play a relevant role as symbionts of metazoans and grazers of prokaryotes and small eukaryotes in the water column and in aggregates.},

            Microbial communities are essential components of aquatic ecosystems through their contribution to food web dynamics and biogeochemical processes. Aquatic microbial diversity is immense and a general challenge is to understand how metabolism and interactions of single organisms shape microbial community dynamics and ecosystem‐scale biogeochemical transformations. Metagenomic approaches have developed rapidly, and proven to be powerful in linking microbial community dynamics to biogeochemical processes. In this review, we provide an overview of metagenomic approaches, followed by a discussion on some recent insights they have provided, including those in this special issue. These include the discovery of new taxa and metabolisms in aquatic microbiomes, insights into community assembly and functional ecology as well as evolutionary processes shaping microbial genomes and microbiomes, and the influence of human activities on aquatic microbiomes. Given that metagenomics can now be considered a mature technology where data generation and descriptive analyses are relatively routine and informative, we then discuss metagenomic‐enabled research avenues to further link microbial dynamics to biogeochemical processes. These include the integration of metagenomics into well‐designed ecological experiments, the use of metagenomics to inform and validate metabolic and biogeochemical models, and the pressing need for ecologically relevant model organisms and simple microbial systems to better interpret the taxonomic and functional information integrated in metagenomes. These research avenues will contribute to a more mechanistic and predictive understanding of links between microbial dynamics and biogeochemical cycles. Owing to rapid climate change and human impacts on aquatic ecosystems, the urgency of such an understanding has never been greater.},

            Environmental molecular sequencing has revealed an abundance of microorganisms that were previously unknown, mainly because most had not been cultured in the laboratory. Within this novel diversity, there are the uncultured MAST clades (MArine STramenopiles), which are major components of marine heterotrophic flagellates (HFs) thought to be active bacterial grazers. In this study, we investigated the gene expression of natural HFs in a mixed community where bacterivory was promoted. Using fluorescence in situ hybridization and 18S rDNA derived from metatranscriptomics, we followed the taxonomic dynamics during the incubation, and confirmed the increase in relative abundance of different MAST lineages. We then used single cell genomes of several MAST species to gain an insight into their most expressed genes, with a particular focus on genes related to phagocytosis. The genomes of MAST‐4A and MAST‐4B were the most represented in the metatranscriptomes, and we identified highly expressed genes of these two species involved in motility and cytoskeleton remodeling, as well as many lysosomal enzymes. Particularly relevant were the cathepsins, which are characteristic digestive enzymes of the phagolysosome and the rhodopsins, perhaps used for vacuole acidification. The combination of single cell genomics and metatranscriptomics gives insights on the phagocytic capacity of uncultured and ecologically relevant HF species.},

              Viruses are the most abundant biological entities on Earth and have fundamental ecological roles in controlling microbial communities. Yet, although their diversity is being increasingly explored, little is known about the extent of viral interactions with their protist hosts as most studies are limited to a few cultivated species. Here, we exploit the potential of single‐cell genomics to unveil viral associations in 65 individual cells of 11 essentially uncultured stramenopiles lineages sampled during the
              Tara
              Oceans expedition. We identified viral signals in 57\% of the cells, covering nearly every lineage and with narrow host specificity signal. Only seven out of the 64 detected viruses displayed homologies to known viral sequences. A search for our viral sequences in global ocean metagenomes showed that they were preferentially found at the DCM and within the 0.2–3 µm size fraction. Some of the viral signals were widely distributed, while others geographically constrained. Among the viral signals we detected an endogenous mavirus virophage potentially integrated within the nuclear genome of two distant uncultured stramenopiles. Virophages have been previously reported as a cell's defence mechanism against other viruses, and may therefore play an important ecological role in regulating protist populations. Our results point to single‐cell genomics as a powerful tool to investigate viral associations in uncultured protists, suggesting a wide distribution of these relationships, and providing new insights into the global viral diversity.},

            How much temporal recurrence is present in microbial assemblages is still an unanswered ecological question. Even though marked seasonal changes have been reported for whole microbial communities, less is known on the dynamics and seasonality of individual taxa. Here, we aim at understanding microbial recurrence at three different levels: community, taxonomic group and operational taxonomic units (OTUs). For that, we focused on a model microbial eukaryotic community populating a long‐term marine microbial observatory using 18S rRNA gene data from two organismal size fractions: the picoplankton (0.2–3 µm) and the nanoplankton (3–20 µm). We have developed an index to quantify recurrence in particular taxa. We found that community structure oscillated systematically between two main configurations corresponding to winter and summer over the 10 years studied. A few taxonomic groups such as Mamiellophyceae or MALV‐III presented clear recurrence (i.e., seasonality), whereas 13\%–19\% of the OTUs in both size fractions, accounting for {\textasciitilde}40\% of the relative abundance, featured recurrent dynamics. Altogether, our work links long‐term whole community dynamics with that of individual OTUs and taxonomic groups, indicating that recurrent and non‐recurrent changes characterize the dynamics of microbial assemblages.

              . 59(5)] and retains an emphasis on protists. Changes since have improved the resolution of many nodes in phylogenetic analyses. For some clades even families are being clearly resolved. As we had predicted, environmental sampling in the intervening years has massively increased the genetic information at hand. Consequently, we have discovered novel clades, exciting new genera and uncovered a massive species level diversity beyond the morphological species descriptions. Several clades known from environmental samples only have now found their home. Sampling soils, deeper marine waters and the deep sea will continue to fill us with surprises. The main changes in this revision are the confirmation that eukaryotes form at least two domains, the loss of monophyly in the Excavata, robust support for the Haptista and Cryptista. We provide suggested primer sets for DNA sequences from environmental samples that are effective for each clade.

              in situ
              hybridization (FISH) to determine the PPE composition and to explore the possible segregation of target groups in the light, nutrient and temperature gradients. Chlorophytes, pelagophytes and prymnesiophytes, in this order of abundance, accounted for the total PPEs recorded by flow cytometry in the Avilés canyon, and for more than half in the Galicia Bank, whereas chrysophytes were undetected. Among the three detected groups, often the prymnesiophytes were dominant in biomass. In general, all groups were present throughout the water column with abundance peaks around the DCM, but their distributions differed: pelagophytes were located deeper than the other two groups, chlorophytes presented two peaks and prymnesiophytes exhibited surface abundances comparable to those at the DCM. This study offers first indications that the vertical distribution of different PPE groups is heterogeneous within the DCM.},

            To test whether protist grazing selectively affects the composition of aquatic bacterial communities, we combined high-throughput sequencing to determine bacterial community composition with analyses of grazing rates, protist and bacterial abundances and bacterial cell sizes and physiological states in a mesocosm experiment in which nutrients were added to stimulate a phytoplankton bloom. A large variability was observed in the abundances of bacteria (from 0.7 to 2.4 × 106 cells per ml), heterotrophic nanoflagellates (from 0.063 to 2.7 × 104 cells per ml) and ciliates (from 100 to 3000 cells per l) during the experiment (∼3-, 45- and 30-fold, respectively), as well as in bulk grazing rates (from 1 to 13 × 106 bacteria per ml per day) and bacterial production (from 3 to 379 μg per C l per day) (1 and 2 orders of magnitude, respectively). However, these strong changes in predation pressure did not induce comparable responses in bacterial community composition, indicating that bacterial community structure was resilient to changes in protist predation pressure. Overall, our results indicate that peaks in protist predation (at least those associated with phytoplankton blooms) do not necessarily trigger substantial changes in the composition of coastal marine bacterioplankton communities.},

            A marine symbiosis has been recently discovered between prymnesiophyte species and the unicellular diazotrophic cyanobacterium UCYN-A. At least two different UCYN-A phylotypes exist, the clade UCYN-A1 in symbiosis with an uncultured small prymnesiophyte and the clade UCYN-A2 in symbiosis with the larger Braarudosphaera bigelowii. We targeted the prymnesiophyte–UCYN-A1 symbiosis by double CARD-FISH (catalyzed reporter deposition-fluorescence in situ hybridization) and analyzed its abundance in surface samples from the MALASPINA circumnavigation expedition. Our use of a specific probe for the prymnesiophyte partner allowed us to verify that this algal species virtually always carried the UCYN-A symbiont, indicating that the association was also obligate for the host. The prymnesiophyte–UCYN-A1 symbiosis was detected in all ocean basins, displaying a patchy distribution with abundances (up to 500 cells ml−1) that could vary orders of magnitude. Additional vertical profiles taken at the NE Atlantic showed that this symbiosis occupied the upper water column and disappeared towards the Deep Chlorophyll Maximum, where the biomass of the prymnesiophyte assemblage peaked. Moreover, sequences of both prymnesiophyte partners were searched within a large 18S rDNA metabarcoding data set from the Tara-Oceans expedition around the world. This sequence-based analysis supported the patchy distribution of the UCYN-A1 host observed by CARD-FISH and highlighted an unexpected homogeneous distribution (at low relative abundance) of B. bigelowii in the open ocean. Our results demonstrate that partners are always in symbiosis in nature and show contrasted ecological patterns of the two related lineages.},

              The opisthokonts are one of the major super groups of eukaryotes. It comprises two major clades: (i) the
              M
              etazoa and their unicellular relatives and (ii) the
              F
              ungi and their unicellular relatives. There is, however, little knowledge of the role of opisthokont microbes in many natural environments, especially among non‐metazoan and non‐fungal opisthokonts. Here, we begin to address this gap by analysing high‐throughput 18
              S rDNA
              and 18
              S rRNA
              sequencing data from different European coastal sites, sampled at different size fractions and depths. In particular, we analyse the diversity and abundance of choanoflagellates, filastereans, ichthyosporeans, nucleariids, corallochytreans and their related lineages. Our results show the great diversity of choanoflagellates in coastal waters as well as a relevant representation of the ichthyosporeans and the uncultured marine opisthokonts (
              MAOP
              ). Furthermore, we describe a new lineage of marine fonticulids (
              MAFO
              ) that appears to be abundant in sediments. Taken together, our work points to a greater potential ecological role for unicellular opisthokonts than previously appreciated in marine environments, both in water column and sediments, and also provides evidence of novel opisthokont phylogenetic lineages. This study highlights the importance of high‐throughput sequencing approaches to unravel the diversity and distribution of both known and novel eukaryotic lineages.},

We tested extensively the method and its limitations using a wide range of sample types and trying several fixation and conservation alternatives.

FC and epifluorescence microscopy (EpiM) were in good agreement and FC yielded lower variability between replicate samples than EpiM. One limitation we encountered was that, in the presence of large bacteria and/or bacterial aggregates, enumeration was difficult. However, in absence of bacterial aggregates samples with Bact/HF ratios {\textgreater} 1000, HF could be well‐enumerated.},

              Very few studies have analysed the niches of pelagic protist in details. This is because for most protists, both an accurate species definition and methods for routine detection and quantification of cells are lacking. The morphospecies
              Micromonas pusilla
              , a marine unicellular green alga, is the most ubiquitous and cosmopolitan picoeukaryote described to date. This species comprises several independent genetic lineages or clades, which are not currently distinguishable based on comparison of their morphology or biogeographical distribution. Molecular probes were used to detect and quantify the genetic clades of
              M. pusilla
              in samples from temperate, polar and tropical environments in order to assess potential ecological niche partitioning. The three clades were detected in all biogeographical regions studied and were commonly found in sympatry. Cell abundances recorded for clades A and B were high, especially at coastal stations. Clade C, when detected, was always at low abundances and is suggested to be a low‐light clade. Shifts in the contribution of clades to total
              M. pusilla
              abundance were observed along environmental gradients, both at local and basin‐wide scales. This suggests that the phylogenetic clades occupy specific niches and confirms the existence of cryptic species within the morphospecies
              M. pusilla
              . Parameters which can precisely explain the distribution of these cryptic species remain to be elucidated.},

              Bacterial and archaeal assemblages have been studied in a multipond solar saltern using a range of microbial ecology techniques by four laboratories simultaneously. These include 16S rDNA sequencing from both denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and clone libraries, and culturing methods. Water samples from eight ponds were analysed, covering a salinity range from near sea water (4\% salt) to saturated sodium chloride (37\% salt; ponds called crystallizers). Clone libraries focused on ponds with salinity of 8\%, 22\% and 32\%. Although different cloning strategies were able to retrieve the same type of dominant sequences, there were differing degrees of success with less abundant sequences. Thus, the use of two sets of primers recovered a higher number of phylotypes. Bacterial and archaeal isolates were, however, different from any of the retrieved environmental sequences. For Bacteria, most sequences in the 8\% salt pond were related to organisms of marine origin. Thus, representatives of the alpha‐, beta‐, gamma‐ and epsilon‐subdivisions of Proteobacteria, the
              Cytophaga–Flavobacterium–Bacteroides
              group (CFB), high‐G+C Gram‐positive bacteria and cyanobacteria were found. In the
 22\% salt pond, alpha‐ and gamma‐Proteobacteria, cyanobacteria and CFB were
 the only groups found, and most of them were related to specialized halophilic bacteria.
 From the 32\% salt pond, only CFB were found, and most of the sequences retrieved
 clustered with
              Salinibacter ruber
              , an extremely halophilic bacterium. A decrease
 in the richness of bacterial genera was therefore apparent along the gradient. Archaea
 behaved quite similarly. In the lowest salinity ponds, sequences were related to
 environmental clones of Marine Archaea Group III (
              Thermoplasmales
              relatives)
 and to unclassified branches of Euryarchaeaota. In the 8\%, 22\% and
 32\% ponds, most of the clones were related to different cultured strains
 of Halobacteriaceae. Finally, most sequences from the crystallizers clustered with
 the uncultured square archaeon SPhT. Crenarchaeaota were not detected. Despite the
 fact that higher prokaryotic richness was apparent in the lower salinity ponds than
 in the crystallizers, the diversity index from clone libraries calculated according
 to Shannon and Weaver did not show this trend. This was because diversity in the
 crystallizers can be considered as ‘microdiversity’, the co‐existence
 of several closely related clones of Bacteria (the
              S. ruber
              cluster) and Archaea (the SPhT cluster). Regardless of the changes in abundance, both Bacteria and Archaea showed the same pattern; as salinity increased, the number of different clusters decreased, and only one cluster became dominant. Both clusters, however, showed a considerable degree of microdiversity. The meaning of such microdiversity remains to be determined.},

            Microbial communities inhabiting a multipond solar saltern were analysed and compared using SSU rRNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR)‐based fingerprintings carried out in parallel by four laboratories. A salinity gradient from seawater (3.7\%) to NaCl precipitation (37\%) was studied for Bacteria, Archaea and Eukarya, and laboratories applied their own techniques and protocols on the same set of samples. Members of all three domains were retrieved from all salt concentrations. Three fingerprinting techniques were used: denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), ribosomal internal spacer analysis (RISA), and terminal‐restriction fragments length polymorphism (T‐RFLP). In addition, each laboratory used its own biomass collection method and DNA extraction protocols. Prokaryotes were addressed using DGGE and RISA with different ‘domain‐specific’ primers sets. Eukaryotes were analysed by one laboratory using DGGE and T‐RFLP, but targeting the same 18S rDNA site. Fingerprints were compared through cluster analysis and non‐metric multidimensional scaling plots. This exercise allowed fast comparison of microbial assemblages and determined to what extent the picture provided by each laboratory was similar to those of others. Formation of two main, salinity‐based groups of samples in prokaryotes (4–15\% and 22–37\% salinity) was consistent for all the laboratories. When other clusters appeared, this was a result of the particular technique and the protocol used in each case, but more affected by the primers set used. Eukaryotic microorganisms changed more from pond to pond; 4–5\% and 8–37\% salinity were but the two main groups detected. Archaea showed the lowest number of bands whereas Eukarya showed the highest number of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) in the initial ponds. Artefacts appeared in the DGGE from ponds with extremely low microbial richness. On the other hand, different 16S rDNA fragments with the same restriction or internal transcribed spacer (ITS) length were the main limitations for T‐RFLP and RISA analyses, respectively, in ponds with the highest OTUs richness. However, although the particular taxonomic composition could vary among protocols, the general structure of the microbial assemblages was maintained.},

	abstract = {Newly described phylogenetic lineages within the domain Archaea have recently been found to be significant components of marine picoplankton assemblages. To better understand the ecology of these microorganisms, we investigated the relative abundance, distribution, and phylogenetic composition of Archaea in the Santa Barbara Channel. Significant amounts of archaeal rRNA and rDNA (genes coding for rRNA) were detected in all samples analyzed. The relative abundance of archaeal rRNA as measured by quantitative oligonucleotide hybridization experiments was low in surface waters but reached higher values (20 to 30\% of prokaryotic rRNA) at depths below 100 m. Probes were developed for the two major groups of marine Archaea detected. rRNA originating from the euryarchaeal group (group II) was most abundant in surface waters, whereas rRNA from the crenarchaeal group (group I) dominated at depth. Clone libraries of PCR-amplified archaeal rRNA genes were constructed with samples from 0 and 200 m deep. Screening of libraries by hybridization with specific oligonucleotide probes, as well as subsequent sequencing of the cloned genes, indicated that virtually all archaeal rDNA clones recovered belonged to one of the two groups. The recovery of cloned rDNA sequence types in depth profiles exhibited the same trends as were observed in quantitative rRNA hybridization experiments. One representative of each of 18 distinct restriction fragment length polymorphism types was partially sequenced. Recovered sequences spanned most of the previously reported phylogenetic diversity detected in planktonic crenarchaeal and euryarchaeal groups. Several rDNA sequences appeared to be harbored in archaeal types which are widely distributed in marine coastal waters. In total, data suggest that marine planktonic crenarchaea and euryarchaea of temperate coastal habitats thrive in different zones of the water column. The relative rRNA abundance of the crenarchaeal group suggests that its members constitute a significant fraction of the prokaryotic biomass in subsurface coastal waters.},

              sp., and of their potential prey, heterotrophic and phototrophic purple bacteria, in Lake Cisó throughout a 1-year cycle. The abundance of both ciliates was very low (less than 2 individuals per ml). During mixing,
              Plagiopyla

              ), its integrated abundance increased with a net doubling time of 47 days, and its potential doubling times, as calculated from the number of bacteria consumed, ranged between 5 and 8 days. During stratification, the activity of
              Plagiopyla
              ciliates was reduced and the population decreased; this was related to the higher amounts of sulfide present. The impact of predation by the
              Plagiopyla
              population on bacterioplankton was found to be insignificant, less than 0.1\% of bacterial biomass consumed per day. Thus, anaerobic ciliates cannot control the bacterioplankton in Lake Cisó because of both the low abundance over the period studied and the low feeding rates during certain periods. A review of available field studies suggests that this conclusion can be extrapolated to most other anoxic systems.},

	abstract = {The trophic role of ciliates in anaerobic food webs has not been assessed experimentally. In order to obtain basic information necessary to interpret field situations, we studied the effects of temperature, sulfide concentration, and food abundance on the growth and feeding activities of two anaerobic ciliates,
              Plagiopyla nasuta
              and
              Metopus es.
              The growth rate of
              P. nasuta
              increased with temperature from 8 to 18°C (
              Q

              -1
              ). Sulfide concentrations of between 0 and 1 mM did not affect the feeding activities, but concentrations greater than 2 mM were inhibitory. The functional response of
              P. nasuta
              feeding on fluorescently labeled heterotrophic and phototrophic bacteria was investigated. In both cases, the parameters of the functional response were almost identical when expressed in terms of biovolume: the maximal uptake rate (
              
                U
                m

              -1
              h
              -1
              and the half-saturation constant for ingestion (
              k
              ) was 1.5 × 10

              ml

              . The functional response of
              M. es
              feeding on heterotrophic bacteria was found to be similar to that of
              P. nasuta.
              These ciliates needed high bacterial abundances in order to maintain their growth (
              k
              of about 4 × 10

              bacteria ml
              -1
              ), implying that they will frequently be food limited in planktonic environments. Both the maximal uptake rates and the maximal clearance rates were comparable to those of aerobic ciliates. By combining the growth and feeding data, we estimated gross growth efficiencies of 12 and 13\% for
              P. nasuta
              and
              M. es
              , respectively. These results indicate that the feeding rates of anaerobic ciliates are similar to those of aerobic ciliates. Their slower growth must, therefore, be due to the lower gross growth efficiency (likely due to anaerobic metabolism).},
