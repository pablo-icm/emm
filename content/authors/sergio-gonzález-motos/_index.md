I am an environmental scientist specialized in marine biology: biodiversity and conservation. I focused my master’s thesis on the study of the relation between marine heterotrophic prokaryotes and fluorescent dissolved organic matter as a way of atmospheric carbon sequestration in order to find a general pattern in the deep ocean. In recent years we have been working on the analysis of viruses and phytoplankton as well. All these tasks have been developed in the context of the FICARAM campaign.

On the other hand, I have also had the opportunity to work at sea. I embarked in 2017 as a Fisheries Scientific Observer on a fishing boat of swordfish and sharks. Labor developed for the Spanish Institute of Oceanography. The campaign lasted 4 months in the sea before finishing in Montevideo, Uruguay. A whole life experience in which I confirmed my love for the sea.

Recently I worked for the COSMO project at the Department of Physical and Technological Oceanography (DOFT-ICM). I designed a database to house data from drifting buoys records available in national and international institutions in geographic areas surrounding the Iberian Peninsula. You can find the final result in this website: https://cosmo.icm.csic.es/

At the moment I am taking part of the Microbial evolution and population genomics in a changing ocean (MINIME) project leaded by Ramiro Logares.
