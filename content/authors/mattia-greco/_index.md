I'm a Beatriu de Pinós Research Fellow at the Institut de Ciències del Mar (ICM) in Barcelona. My research examines how molecular evolution and environmental changes shape microbial diversity in the ocean, including the use of microbes as bioindicators of ecosystem health.

Here at ICM, my project investigates the structure of microbial eukaryote communities in the ocean. I employ a metagenomic approach to study these communities, aiming to understand their composition, diversity, and ecological roles.
