I am a Juan de la Cierva Research Fellow at the Institut de Ciències del Mar (ICM) in Barcelona. My primary research interest is to explore how molecular evolution and environmental factors influence microbial diversity, with a particular focus on foraminifera. Specifically, I investigate their use as bioindicators, as well as their interactions, ecology, and evolution, using bioinformatic and quantitative methods.
Currently, my research at the ICM centers on investigating the structure of microbial eukaryote communities in the ocean. I employ a metagenomic approach to study these communities, aiming to understand their composition, diversity, and ecological roles.
