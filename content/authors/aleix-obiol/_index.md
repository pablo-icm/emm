I am a microbial ecologist specializing in marine microbial eukaryotes (protists), with a focus on understanding their diversity and functional roles in the ocean. My research centers on heterotrophic flagellates, a key yet understudied group of protists. To address this knowledge gap, I integrate omics datasets at global and local scales with traditional methods such as microscopy. Currently, my work focuses on deciphering gene expression dynamics during phagocytosis–the process by which heterotrophic flagellates engulf bacteria–providing critical insights into their role in global biogeochemical cycles.
