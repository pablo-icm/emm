Researcher in Marine Sciences, specialized in Bioinformatics, Biostatistics and Marine Microbial Ecology, currently developing my PhD at the Institute of Marine Sciences (ICM-CSIC). 

My research explores the **temporal dynamics of planktonic viruses** and their interactions with microbial communities in oligotrophic coastal systems, with a focus on the Blanes Bay Microbial Observatory (BBMO). Combining long-term environmental monitoring, **metagenomics**, and **single-cell genomic approaches**, I investigate how viruses are influenced by microbial community composition, nutrient cycling, and ecosystem functioning. Part of my work seeks to characterize **previously unidentified links between giant viruses and their microeukaryotic hosts**, shedding light on their natural dynamics. Additionally, my work examines the impact of climate-driven changes, such as rising temperatures and increasing oligotrophy, on viral abundance and diversity, providing insights into the evolving roles of marine viruses in microbial food webs and biogeochemical cycles.

Outside of science, I am passionate about the ocean and enjoy diving and Crossfit. I am also a proud member of the **Equality and Diversity group** at the ICM-CSIC. Currently, I am working on an action plan and harrasment protocol in collaboration with [PRISMA association](https://prismaciencia.org/) to ensure the protection and rights of LGBTQIA+ individuals in the ICM ([Read our latest article](https://www.icm.csic.es/en/news/towards-lgbtiqa-inclusion-science)).
