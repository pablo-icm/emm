Researcher in Marine Sciences, specialized in Marine Microbial Ecology, Bioinformatics and Biostatistics. currently developing my PhD at the ICM-CSIC. My thesis deals with the temporal trends of planktonic viruses in an oligotrophic coastal system (DIVAS). I intend to evaluate the changes that virus-picoeukaryotic interactions undergo over time in Blanes Bay Microbial Observatory (BBMO).
 
I am passionate about everything that surrounds the sea and science, both in the field and in the laboratory. So much so that I studied Marine Sciences at the University of Vigo (UVIGO). Later, I became interested in the world of microbial ecology, so I did a master’s degree in Marine Ecology (Universitat de les Illes Balears-UIB) in which I worked with anthropogenic impact (microplastics) on the nitrogen-fixing microbiota of Posidonia Oceanica (Marine Ecology and Systematics -MarES- Research group). In addition, I got into another master’s degree in Bioinformatics and Biostatistics (Universitat Oberta de Catalunya) in which I developed my master’s thesis in collaboration with the EMM of the ICM-CSIC, “Taxonomic classification of assemblages of protists ordered by cells from the Bay of Blanes by means of long-read metagenomics “.
