I am a marine microbiologist and I achieved my PhD in oceanography here at ICM in 2014. I am mainly interested in marine eukaryotes and their interactions with other components of the microbial community. At the moment I am working as lab technician at the laboratory of Flow cytometry belonging to the department of Marine Biology and Oceanography. The main goal of this facility is the counting and characterization of plankton components like bacteria, eukaryotes and virus. In this frame my main tasks are formation and support of new users and analyses of several types of marine samples. I am also working on developing new methods and applications in order to better define different marine population through flow cytometry (e.g. active bacteria versus dormant). In parallel to these activities I keep nurturing my personal research interests and projects.
