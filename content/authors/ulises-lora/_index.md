I started working as a laboratory technician at the Department of Marine Biology and
Oceanography in 2023.

I have a Master’s degree in Oceanography and Marine Environment Management (UB) and 
a Bachelor’s degree in Biomedical Sciences (UB). Montse Sala (ICM) was my 
supervisor on both my Master thesis (Effects of conventional and biodegradable 
microplastics on marine microbial communities) and my Bachelor dissertation 
(Characterization of aerial microbial communities by CARD-FISH). Apart from that, I 
have also participated in the Aquacosm Transnational Access program in Helsinki (2019) 
to get the data I used for my Master thesis and I came back in 2023 to carry out a project
about the role of planktonic food webs in the fate of biodegradable polymers (PLGA)
which I am currently working on. My main tasks have been the design of the
experimental set up, sampling and data process, with laboratory work taking big part of
it using fluorescent techniques like CARD-FISH and BONCAT-FISH, flow cytometry,
FlowCam and epifluorescence microscopy.

By studying the degradation of plastics, I believe we can make people be aware of the
current situation of the seas, and hopefully find a solution to the problem. I love being
involved in projects where many people enjoy this topic and we all cooperate to 
achieve this goal.
