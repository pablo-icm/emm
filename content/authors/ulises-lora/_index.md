I started working as a laboratory technician at the Department of Marine Biology and
Oceanography in 2023.

I have a Bachelor’s degree in Biomedical Sciences (UB) and a Master’s degree in
Oceanography and Marine Environment Management (UB). Montse Sala (ICM) was
my supervisor on both my Bachelor dissertation (Characterization of aerial microbial
communities by CARD-FISH) and my Master thesis (Effects of conventional and
biodegradable microplastics on marine microbial communities). Apart from that, I have
also participated in the Aquacosm Transnational Access program in Helsinki (2019) to
get the data I used for my Master thesis and I came back in 2023 to carry out a project
about the role of planktonic food webs in the fate of biodegradable polymers (PLGA)
which I am currently working on. My main tasks have been the design of the
experimental set up, sampling and data process, with laboratory work taking big part of
it using fluorescent techniques like CARD-FISH and BONCAT-FISH, flow cytometry,
FlowCam and epifluorescence microscopy.

By studying the degradation of plastics, I believe we can make people be aware of the
current situation of the seas, and hopefully find a solution to the problem. I love being
involved in projects where many people enjoy this topic and we all cooperate for this
goal.
