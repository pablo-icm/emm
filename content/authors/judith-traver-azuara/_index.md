As a great sea lover, I graduated in Marine Science/Oceanography from the Catholic University of Valencia (UCV) in 2017 and I travel from Valencia to Costa Rica to investigate some macroalgae; it was there where my marine algae genomics interests started thanks to my thesis. After that, I studied a Master degree in Environmental Assessment and Monitoring of marine and coastal ecosystems in the Polytechnic University of Valencia during 2017/18. This time my master’s thesis was not focused on marine genomics because I embarked on a cetacean acoustics campaign, something I had always liked very much. During those years, and until recently, I worked as a marine environmental educator. I transmitted all my sea passion to many people. After that I started as dolphin marine keeper, a lovely world and work. However, I have always been interested in continuing to study marine genomics. For this reason, I was a collaborator in two projects related to the environmental study of marine ecosystems through the use of NGS at the UCV. In February 2022 I started as Predoct at the Institut de Ciències del Mar. My thesis is part of the project PRODIGIO and INCEPTION, in which using genomics, we will analyze the microbial dynamics of microalgae industrial cultures.
