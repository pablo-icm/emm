I am Marie Curie research fellow working on the ‘WildE’ research project. I am molecular ecologist and evolutionary biologist interested how environmental drivers shape populations at the phenotypic and molecular level. I received my PhD and the University of Edinburgh (Institute of Evolutionary Biology) in 2016 and I have since completed two postdoctoral positions. During my first postdoc at Bangor University, in collaboration with  PollerGEN, I used eDNA methods to measure the biodiversity and quantity of airborne pollen, with a special focus on grasses and allergy (2016 – 2019). I recently completed a short project at Lund University measuring the biodiversity of fish and invertebrates in streams in southern Sweden, using eDNA metabarcoding (2019 -2020).

I am now working at ICM-CSIC on the MSCA funded research ‘WildE’. This project uses molecular tools to directly measure the rate of microevolution of ecologically important marine microbes to explore how globally important microbes will respond to climate change.
