I have recently started a PhD in marine microbial ecology, supervised by Olga Sánchez and Josep M. Gasol. I studied Biochemistry and Molecular Biology in Universitat Rovira i Virgili (Tarragona) and got a Master’s Degree in Applied Microbiology in Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona (UAB), having done stays in Poland and Finland. I have worked as a mosquito breeder and SARS-CoV2 detector. My thesis will involve testing the diversity of marine bacteria through traditional culturing methods, high-throughput sequencing and bioinformatic analyses, with a focus on understanding “bloomer” species.

Other than science, I am deeply interested in music, being piano and derivates (synthesyzers, electric organ) my main instruments. I also like human towers or “castells”.
