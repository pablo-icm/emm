I am a postdoctoral fellow at the ICM on a MSCA project called ‘FROM’. I am interested in theoretical ecology, particularly in testing ecological hypotheses with environmental observations. My research focus on understanding what structures marine microbial communities and how these communities structure retro-actively their ecosystem. During my PhD (2015-2018) at the ‘Ifremer de Brest’ and the ‘Station Biologique de Roscoff’ (France), I studied the functional ecology of marine protist in North-Atlantic coastal ecosystems. During my first postdoc at the ‘NIOZ’ institute (Netherlands; 2020-2022), I have been working on novel approaches to infer the interactions that take place in the microbial ecosystem of the Wadden-Sea. I have always taken part in multidisciplinary projects, combining together molecular, biogeochemical and computational tools to better understand environmental patterns. Within ‘FROM’ and at the ICM, I will make use of molecular data on the ocean’s microbiome to study the functional redundancy of microbes, a crucial topic to predict how will microbial communities affect ecosystems in a changing ocean.
