I work as a Research Laboratory Technician at ICM-CSIC with Clara Ruiz-González since 2024, investigating how submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) shapes microbial diversity, function, and connectivity at the land–sea interface. I completed both my Bachelor’s degree in Marine Sciences and my Master’s degree in Environmental Microbiology at the Universitat de Barcelona. Prior to my current position at the ICM, I conducted my Master’s thesis in the same institute under the supervision of Francisco Cornejo, from September 2023 to June 2024.

Now, I support field sampling during research campaigns and perform laboratory analyses using a range of molecular techniques—including DNA extractions, conventional and quantitative PCR (qPCR), and flow cytometry—to explore the microbial dimension of SGD. In addition, I contribute to bioinformatics analyses, assisting in the interpretation of molecular data
