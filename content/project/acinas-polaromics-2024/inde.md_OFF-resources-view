POLAROMICS is a multidisciplinary project integrating different areas of expertise in microbiology, ecology, genomics, bioinformatics, and evolution that share the same overall objective of understanding 1) the biogeographical patterns and ecological connectivity of microbiomes across different polar biomes, 2) the evolutionary diversification process and 3) survival strategies for the adaptation of polar microbes
