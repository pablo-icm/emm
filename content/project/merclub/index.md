title: MERcury CLean-Up system based on Bioremediation by marine bacteria (MER-CLUB)
summary: Marine microorganisms hold the genetic potential for Hg detoxification. MER-CLUB projects aims to unreveil and exploit it for the bioremediation of Hg-contaminated marine sediments.

## The project
A pilot study will be performed in the facilities of AFESA Medio Amiente S.A. using dregded Hg contaminated sediments as a proof of concept of the developed MER-CLUB technology.

## Main objetives

MER-CLUB will target the largely unexplored diversity of marine Hg detoxifiers, the isolation of novel detoxifying marine strains, and their application in a clean-up system based on immobilized bacteria able to operate in dredged marine sediments.
Combined bioaugmentation and biostimulation strategies will be evaluated and scaled up, from experimental microcosms to a bioreactor pilot study. The clean-up system will serve as a proof of concept for further development and commercial implementation facilitated by strong stakeholder involvement.   


## Results and Impacts

MER-CLUB will enhance the cooperation of six international high-level research groups and an enterprise to build a multidisciplinary partnership towards the objective of designing a novel, pre-marketable Hg clean-up system for restoring Hg-impacted marine environments.
Up to 4 jobs will be created for specialization in Hg bioremediation, and stakeholders and the general public will be engaged by active strategies of dissemination.

## Pilot study

A pilot study will be performed in the facilities of AFESA Medio Amiente S.A. using dregded Hg contaminated sediments as a proof of concept of the developed MER-CLUB technology.
These areas of expertise and their large experience will support the implementation of the scientific knowledge generated in MER-CLUB:

- Disassembly, demolition, scrapping and selective valorisation of industrial facilities (such as chlor-alkali plants),  
- Research and treatment of contaminated soils, aquifers and industrial ruins,  
- Integrated waste management and emergency response.
