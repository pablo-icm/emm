	abstract = {Viruses play a pivotal role in ecosystems by influencing biochemical cycles and impacting the structure and evolution of their host cells. The widespread pelagiphages infect Pelagibacter spp., the most abundant marine microbe on Earth, and thus play a significant role in carbon transformation through the viral shunt. Among these viruses, the uncultured lytic pelagiphage vSAG 37-F6, uncovered by single-virus genomics, is likely the most numerous virus in the ocean. While previous research has delved into the diversity and spatial distribution of vSAG 37-F6, there is still a gap in understanding its temporal dynamics, hindering our insight into its ecological impact. We explored the temporal dynamics of vSAG 37-F6, assessing periodic fluctuations in abundance and evolutionary patterns using long- and short-term data series. In the long-term series (7 years), metagenomics showed negative selection acting on all viral genes, with a highly conserved overall diversity over time composed of a pool of yearly emergent, highly similar novel strains that exhibited a seasonal abundance pattern with two peaks during winter and fall and a decrease in months with higher UV radiation. Most non-synonymous polymorphisms occurred in structural viral proteins located in regions with low conformational restrictions, suggesting that many of the viral genes of this population are highly purified over its evolution. At the fine-scale resolution (24 h time series), combining digital PCR and metagenomics, we identified two peaks of cellular infection for the targeted vSAG 37-F6 viral strain (up to approximately 103 copies/ng of prokaryotic DNA), one before sunrise and the second shortly after midday. Considering the high number of co-occurring strains of this microdiverse virus, the abundance values at the species or genus level could be orders of magnitudes higher. These findings represent a significant advancement in understanding the dynamics of the potentially most abundant oceanic virus, providing valuable insights into ecologically relevant marine viruses.},

	abstract = {The global ocean genome (the pool of genes in marine organisms and the functional information they encode) is a major, untapped resource for science and society with a growing range of biotechnology applications in sectors such as biomedicine, energy, and food. Shotgun sequencing and metagenomics can now be used to catalog the diversity of ocean microbial life and to explore its functional potential, but has been limited by sample coverage, access to suitable sequencing platforms, and computational capacity. Here we provide a novel synthesis of the global ocean genome based on analysis of 2,102 sampled ocean metagenomes, with gene assembly and annotation via the KAUST Metagenome Analysis Platform (KMAP) Global Ocean Gene Catalog 1.0 containing 308.6 million gene clusters. Taxonomically, we report the distribution of marine genes across the tree of life and different ocean basins and depth zone biomes. Functionally, we map its relationship to protein families and biogeochemical processes, including the major microbial metabolic pathways that process three elements that play fundamental roles in biogeochemical cycles and are relevant to climate change. These data extend our understanding of the complex, dynamic nature of the ocean microbiome and its metabolic capabilities. Further research is of critical global importance both to unlock the potential of the ocean genome and to understand and predict the effects of human-induced changes, including pollution and climate change. Further hypothesis-driven research should target under-sampled deep sea and benthic microbial communities using enhanced metagenomic methods, to better understand marine ecosystem functioning. Investment in the necessary computational capacity is essential, as are suitable intellectual property frameworks.},

              Aerobic anoxygenic phototrophic (AAP) bacteria are a common part of microbial communities in the sunlit ocean. They contain bacteriochlorophyll

Across different oceanic regions, AAP bacteria seem to be more abundant in eutrophic areas, associated with high chlorophyll concentrations. While most previous studies focused on surface samplings, there is limited information regarding their vertical distribution in euphotic zones of the major ocean basins. Here, we hypothesized that AAP bacteria will follow a similar structure to the chlorophyll depth profile across areas with different degrees of stratification. To test this hypothesis, we enumerated AAP cells and determined bulk water BChl

              concentrations along the photic zone of a latitudinal transect in the South and Central Atlantic Ocean. Overall, the distribution of AAP bacteria was highly correlated to that of chlorophyll
              a
              and to the abundance of picophytoplankton across both vertical and horizontal gradients. Furthermore, estimated light energy captured across the water column showed that, while AAP bacteria share a common latitudinal pattern of light absorption with picophytoplankton, they display a unique vertical arrangement with highest photoheterotrophic activity in the top 50 m of the surface ocean.},

                Aerobic anoxygenic phototrophic (AAP) bacteria harvest light energy using bacteriochlorophyll-containing reaction centers to supplement their mostly heterotrophic metabolism. While their abundance and growth have been intensively studied in coastal environments, much less is known about their activity in oligotrophic open ocean regions. Therefore, we combined
                in situ
                sampling in the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre, north of O'ahu island, Hawaii, with two manipulation experiments. Infra-red epifluorescence microscopy documented that AAP bacteria represented approximately 2\% of total bacteria in the euphotic zone with the maximum abundance in the upper 50 m. They conducted active photosynthetic electron transport with maximum rates up to 50 electrons per reaction center per second. The
                in situ
                decline of bacteriochlorophyll concentration over the daylight period, an estimate of loss rates due to predation, indicated that the AAP bacteria in the upper 50 m of the water column turned over at rates of 0.75–0.90 d
                −1
                . This corresponded well with the specific growth rate determined in dilution experiments where AAP bacteria grew at a rate 1.05 ± 0.09 d
                −1
                . An amendment of inorganic nitrogen to obtain N:P = 32 resulted in a more than 10 times increase in AAP abundance over 6 days. The presented data document that AAP bacteria are an active part of the bacterioplankton community in the oligotrophic North Pacific Subtropical Gyre and that their growth was mostly controlled by nitrogen availability and grazing pressure.
              
              
                IMPORTANCE
                Marine bacteria represent a complex assembly of species with different physiology, metabolism, and substrate preferences. We focus on a specific functional group of marine bacteria called aerobic anoxygenic phototrophs. These photoheterotrophic organisms require organic carbon substrates for growth, but they can also supplement their metabolic needs with light energy captured by bacteriochlorophyll. These bacteria have been intensively studied in coastal regions, but rather less is known about their distribution, growth, and mortality in the oligotrophic open ocean. Therefore, we conducted a suite of measurements in the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre to determine the distribution of these organisms in the water column and their growth and mortality rates. A nutrient amendment experiment showed that aerobic anoxygenic phototrophs were limited by inorganic nitrogen. Despite this, they grew more rapidly than average heterotrophic bacteria, but their growth was balanced by intense grazing pressure.

              Microbes drive the biogeochemical cycles of marine ecosystems through their vast metabolic diversity. While we have a fairly good understanding of the spatial distribution of these metabolic processes in various ecosystems, less is known about their seasonal dynamics. We investigated the annual patterns of 21 biogeochemical relevant functions in an oligotrophic coastal ocean site by analysing the presence of key genes, analysing high‐rank gene taxonomy and the dynamics of nucleotide variants. Most genes presented seasonality: photoheterotrophic processes were enriched during spring, phosphorous‐related genes were dominant during summer, coinciding with potential phosphate limitation, and assimilatory nitrate reductases appeared mostly during summer and autumn, correlating negatively with nitrate availability. Additionally, we identified the main taxa driving each function at each season and described the role of underrecognized taxa such as
              Litoricolaceae
              in carbon fixation (
              rbcL

              ), and CO oxidation (
              coxL
              ). Finally, the seasonality of single variants of some families presented a decoupling between the taxonomic abundance patterns and the functional gene patterns, implying functional specialization of the different genera. Our study unveils the seasonality of key biogeochemical functions and the main taxonomic groups that harbour these relevant functions in a coastal ocean ecosystem.},

	abstract = {On a standard oceanographic cruise, flow cytometry data are usually collected sparsely through a bottle-based sampling and with stations separated by kilometers leading to a fragmented view of the ecosystem; to improve the resolution of the datasets produced by this technique here it is proposed the application of an automatic method of sampling and staining. The system used consists of a flow-cytometer (Accuri-C6) connected to an automated continuous sampler (OC-300) that collects samples of marine surface waters every 15 min. We tested this system for five days during a brief Mediterranean cruise with the aim of estimating the abundance, relative size and phenotypic diversity of prokaryotes. Seawater was taken by a faucet linked to an inlet pump (
              ca.
              5 m depth). Once the sample was taken, the Oncyt-300 stained it and sent it to the flow cytometer. A total of 366 samples were collected, effectively achieving a fine-grained scale view of microbial community composition both through space and time. A significative positive relationship was found comparing data obtained with the automatic method and 10 samples collected from the faucet but processed with the standard protocol. Abundance values retrieved varied from 3.56·10

The measured features (abundance and size) were associated with metadata (temperature, salinity, conductivity) also taken in continuous, of which conductivity was the one that better explained the variability of abundance. A full 24 h measurement cycle was performed resulting in slightly higher median bacterial abundances values during daylight hours compared to night. Alpha diversity, calculated using computational cytometry techniques, showed a higher value in the coastal area above 41° of latitude and had a strong inverse relationship with both salinity and conductivity. This is the first time to our knowledge that the OC-300 is directly applied to the marine environment during an oceanographic cruise; due to its high-resolution, this set-up shows great potential both to cover large sampling areas, and to monitor day-night cycles

              Phytoplankton account for {\textgreater}45\% of global primary production, and have an enormous impact on aquatic food webs and on the entire Earth System. Their members are found among prokaryotes (cyanobacteria) and multiple eukaryotic lineages containing chloroplasts. Genetic surveys of phytoplankton communities generally consist of PCR amplification of bacterial (16S), nuclear (18S) and/or chloroplastic (16S) rRNA marker genes from DNA extracted from environmental samples. However, our appreciation of phytoplankton abundance or biomass is limited by PCR‐amplification biases, rRNA gene copy number variations across taxa, and the fact that rRNA genes do not provide insights into metabolic traits such as photosynthesis. Here, we targeted the photosynthetic gene
              psbO
              from metagenomes to circumvent these limitations: the method is PCR‐free, and the gene is universally and exclusively present in photosynthetic prokaryotes and eukaryotes, mainly in one copy per genome. We applied and validated this new strategy with the size‐fractionated marine samples collected by
              Tara
              Oceans, and showed improved correlations with flow cytometry and microscopy than when based on rRNA genes. Furthermore, we revealed unexpected features of the ecology of these ecosystems, such as the high abundance of picocyanobacterial aggregates and symbionts in the ocean, and the decrease in relative abundance of phototrophs towards the larger size classes of marine dinoflagellates. To facilitate the incorporation of
              psbO
              in molecular‐based surveys, we compiled a curated database of {\textgreater}18,000 unique sequences. Overall,
              psbO
              appears to be a promising new gene marker for molecular‐based evaluations of entire phytoplankton communities.

              Isolation of microorganisms is a useful approach to gathering knowledge about their genomic properties, physiology, and ecology, in addition to allowing the characterization of novel taxa. We performed an extensive isolation effort on samples from seawater manipulation experiments that were carried out during the four astronomical seasons in a coastal site of the northwest Mediterranean to evaluate the impact of grazing, viral mortality, resource competition reduction, and light presence/absence on bacterioplankton growth. Isolates were retrieved using two growth media, and their full 16S rRNA gene was sequenced to assess their identity and calculate their culturability across seasons and experimental conditions. A total of 1,643 isolates were obtained, mainly affiliated to the classes
              Gammaproteobacteria
              (44\%),
              Alphaproteobacteria
              (26\%), and
              Bacteroidia
              (17\%). Isolates pertaining to class
              Gammaproteobacteria
              were the most abundant in all experiments, while
              Bacteroidia
              were preferentially enriched in the treatments with reduced grazing. Sixty-one isolates had a similarity below 97\% to cultured taxa and are thus putatively novel. Comparison of isolate sequences with 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequences from the same samples showed that the percentage of reads corresponding to isolates was 21.4\% within the whole data set, with dramatic increases in the summer virus-reduced (71\%) and diluted (47\%) treatments. In fact, we were able to isolate the top 10 abundant taxa in several experiments and from the whole data set. We also show that top-down and bottom-up controls differentially affect taxa in terms of culturability. Our results indicate that culturing marine bacteria using agar plates can be successful in certain ecological situations.
            
            
              IMPORTANCE
              Bottom-up and top-down controls greatly influence marine microbial community composition and dynamics, which in turn have effects on their culturability. We isolated a high amount of heterotrophic bacterial strains from experiments where seawater environmental conditions had been manipulated and found that decreasing grazing and viral pressure as well as rising nutrient availability are key factors increasing the success in culturing marine bacteria. Our data hint at factors influencing culturability and underpin bacterial cultures as a powerful way to discover new taxa.

            Bacteria display dynamic abundance fluctuations over time in marine environments, where they play key biogeochemical roles. Here, we characterized the seasonal dynamics of marine bacteria in a coastal oligotrophic time series station, tested how similar the temporal niche of closely related taxa is, and what are the environmental parameters modulating their seasonal abundance patterns. We further explored how conserved the niche is at higher taxonomic levels. The community presented recurrent patterns of seasonality for 297 out of 6825 amplicon sequence variants (ASVs), which constituted almost half of the total relative abundance (47\%). For certain genera, niche similarity decreased as nucleotide divergence in the 16S rRNA gene increased, a pattern compatible with the selection of similar taxa through environmental filtering. Additionally, we observed evidence of seasonal differentiation within various genera as seen by the distinct seasonal patterns of closely related taxa. At broader taxonomic levels, coherent seasonal trends did not exist at the class level, while the order and family ranks depended on the patterns that existed at the genus level. This study identifies the coexistence of closely related taxa for some bacterial groups and seasonal differentiation for others in a coastal marine environment subjected to a strong seasonality.},

	abstract = {Coastal ecosystems deteriorate globally due to human-induced stress factors, like nutrient loading and pollution. Bacteria are critical to marine ecosystems, e.g., by regulating nutrient cycles, synthesizing vitamins, or degrading pollutants, thereby providing essential ecosystem services ultimately affecting economic activities. Yet, until now bacteria are overlooked both as mediators and indicators of ecosystem health, mainly due to methodological limitations in assessing bacterial ecosystem functions. However, these limitations are largely overcome by the advances in molecular biology and bioinformatics methods for characterizing the genetics that underlie functional traits of key bacterial populations – “key” in providing important ecosystem services, being abundant, or by possessing high metabolic rates. It is therefore timely to analyze and define the functional responses of bacteria to human-induced effects on coastal ecosystem health. We posit that categorizing the responses of key marine bacterial populations to changes in environmental conditions through modern microbial oceanography methods will allow establishing the nascent field of genetic counselling for our coastal waters. This requires systematic field studies of linkages between functional traits of key bacterial populations and their ecosystem functions in coastal seas, complemented with systematic experimental analyses of the responses to different stressors. Research and training in environmental management along with dissemination of results and dialogue with societal actors are equally important to ensure the role of bacteria is understood as fundamentally important for coastal ecosystems. Using the responses of microorganisms as a tool to develop genetic counselling for coastal ecosystems can ultimately allow for integrating bacteria as indicators of environmental change.},

The diversity of free-living and particle-attached prokaryotic assemblages was investigated with the aim to understand how the microbial communities are structured in the two fractions and whether specific microbial groups are associated to one lifestyle or the other. The results highlight a diverse prokaryotic community dominated by Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and, remarkably, Firmicutes. Taxa within Firmicutes and Alphaproteobacteria are identified as the main particle-attached indicators by LEfSe, while members of Bacteroidetes and Gammaproteobacteria were representative of the free-living lifestyle, although they were also usually found as particle-attached.
